To upload library to anaconda.org, we will build library from pypi

Upload version to pypi and then change version in meta.yaml and also change sha256 (copy it from https://pypi.org/project/rvt-py/#files -> view hashes for source distribution)

To create package builds and upload them to conda cloud:
	change and run upload_conda.py
