Before starting, don't forget to add changes to changelog (docs/releases.rst)!

Upload checklist:

0. Update README.md (this file is used as long_description for PyPI)

1. Change version in setup.py

2. Check if any other changes in setup.py are needed

3. Install or upgrade setuptools & twine:
"python -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel"
"python -m pip install --user --upgrade twine"

4. Build package (creates dist folder, with *.whl and *.tar.gz files)
"python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel"

5. Test upload to TestPyPI:
"python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*"

    - username: "__token__", password: TestPyPI token (https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken)

6. Follow the URL of the test upload
    - check if README was rendered correctly
    - check if pip install works > create new venv and run
"pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple rvt-py==2.2.2"

   [ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple  ..... is needed to install dependencies ]

7. If test upload works fine, proceed with actual upload
"python -m twine upload dist/*"

    - username: "__token__", password: TestPyPI token (https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken)


FYI:
* TestPyPI and PyPI are completely separate websites, you need to register on both!


pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple rvt-py==2.2.2
