Installation
============

RVT can be installed as a package for Python, where it can be used in Python scripts, Jupyter Notebooks and ArcGIS Pro.

RVT can also be installed as a set of custom raster functions for ArcGIS, and a plugin for QGIS.

You can also clone the repository (`GitHub rvt_py <https://github.com/EarthObservation/RVT_py>`_).

Requirements
------------

Required libraries (specified versions have been tested, other versions may also work):

*   numpy 1.19.2
*   scipy 1.5.2
*   gdal 3.0.2

We recommend using Python 3.6 or higher and a Conda environment (this works best with ``gdal``).
