Choosing a visualization
========================

When choosing a visualization, it is recommended to always begin by looking at a hillshade of the area under investigation. They provide the most ‘natural’ visual appearance of the topography and can help you decide which other techniques could work well.

By feature type
---------------

If you need some help to get started after trying a hillshade, consider the type of feature you're working with:

By topography type
------------------

You can also try adding techniques from Table 2, in order from left to right, based on the topography of the area under investigation (see visual examples below).
