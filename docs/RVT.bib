 abstract = {The objective of this study was to map traces of the past Carpathian landscape recorded in the microtopography in the chosen study area (25 km2) within the Wiar river basin. The area comprised two deserted villages (Borys{\l}awka and Posada Rybotycka) that were abandoned and afforested after forced displacement of Ruthenian highlanders in 1940s. Three groups of complementary research methods were used: remote sensing (airborne laser scanning - ALS as the main data source), analysis of archival sources and field survey. Sky-view factor (SVF) was applied as the main visualisation technique of the LiDAR-derived DTM for mapping purposes. The results demonstrated that there are numerous, well preserved earthworks created before World War II lying under the tree canopy, such as hollow ways, agricultural terraces, remnants of settlements, border mounds etc. They form a unique cultural heritage of former inhabitants that deserves to be protected. {\copyright} Geographia Polonica.},

 abstract = {The aim of the research was to determine the scale and forms of logging road impacts on the natural environment and residual cultural heritage of Ruthenian Highlanders that characterise the Polish part of the north-eastern Carpathians. To this end, we used LiDAR-derived DEM to detect and map forest roads and skid trails, and to estimate road density, in 60 forest divisions sampled at random from among the 2639 km2 of forest managed in the above region by the State Forests National Forest Holding. The determined road network was then validated by GPS ground control. Supplementary, detailed LiDAR data were used to detect features of the past cultural landscape, and to determine the interference in that due to contemporary logging roads. Overall skidder traffic was estimated on the basis of a thorough analysis of State Forests documents, including legal acts, guidelines, management plans, detailed databases and maps of planned cuts. LiDAR data proved to be an adequate tool in the mapping of the network of logging roads present under the tree canopy, although it slightly underestimates road density in a densely vegetated, post-landslide topography. Our LiDAR-assessed density of Carpathian logging roads (at 108.5--140.7 m ha$-$1, including skid trails) is nevertheless among the highest reported in the literature, and one that far exceeds recommended values. Spatial pattern analysis further revealed the unfavourable phenomenon of multiple parallel roads forming contiguous areas of disturbed soil and constituting dispersal paths for invasive plants. Many examples of cultural remains being run over and destroyed by skidders could also be reported. The observed process of log extraction is one of the least sustainable aspects to forest management in the Carpathians, and our results emphasise very clearly the need for rules to support the preservation of cultural heritage in forested areas, as well as improved tools by which skidding practices can be monitored. {\copyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {Government geological survey maps and research publications have portrayed the distribution of glacial landforms associated with the advance and retreat of the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets across Alberta at a local, regional, and continental scale. To date, this information has not been systematically synthesized into a single compilation at a consistent scale. Although this original work provided valuable information to constrain reconstructions of former ice sheet extent, configuration, and flow geometry, its derivation primarily from the interpretation of aerial photographs and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission 90 m digital elevation model (DEM) may result in methodological inconsistencies and spatial biases. These biases, together with challenges associated with geomorphic mapping indensely forested areas of western and northern Alberta limit the usefulness of previous mapping when applied to inversion-based ice sheet reconstructions, which have specific input data demands. Recently, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) DEMs have become increasingly available throughout Alberta. Hill-shaded imagery of these data provides unprecedented geomorphic detail beneath the forest cover and reveals that that the glacial geomorphology of northern and western Alberta is more complex than previously recognized. In this paper, we describe the methodology and geomorphic criteria used to produce a glacial landform map of Alberta using previously published data, supplemented by comprehensive new analysis of high-resolution (2--25 m) DEMs. These include 306 624 km2 of LiDAR imagery, with which it is now possible to verify and where necessary augment previous mapping, particularly across areas with a dense forest cover. {\copyright} 2014, National Research Council of Canada.

 abstract = {While the National Record of the Historic Environment (NRHE) in Scotland contains valuable information on more than 170,000 archaeological monuments, it is clear that this dataset is conditioned by the disposition of past survey and changing parameters of data collection strategies over many decades. This highlights the importance of creating systematic datasets, in which the standards to which they were created are explicit, and against which the reliability of our knowledge of the material remains of the past can be assessed. This paper describes issues of data structure and reliability, then discussing the methodologies under development for expediting the progress of national-scale mapping with specific reference to the Isle of Arran. Preliminary outcomes of a recent archaeological mapping project of the island, which has been used to develop protocols for rapid large area mapping, are outlined. The primary sources for the survey were airborne laser scanning derivatives and orthophotographs, supplemented by field observation, and the project has more than doubled the number of known monuments of Arran. The survey procedures are described, followed by a discussion of the utility of `general purpose' remote sensed datasets, focusing on the assessment of strengths and weaknesses for rapid mapping of large areas. {\copyright} 2018 by the authors.

 abstract = {While airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is a key resource for studying afforested landscapes, other datasets are essential to understanding the character of surveyed areas, and for assessing the reliability of the remote sensed data interpretation. This article presents results of such assessment based on the analysis of contemporary forestry data and historic maps for a study area located south of Polan{\'o}w, Poland, which was subject of bespoke ALS survey. Forestry data and historic maps were initially used to plan ALS data collection, and thereafter to assess data quality and bias. As a result, the longevity and patterning of afforestation were determined and these correlate with the outputs of interpretative mapping together offering a benchmark methodology for identifying survival zones for prehistoric and early medieval earthworks beyond the extents of early and late modern cultivation. In addition, the data characteristics discussed in this article demonstrate the importance of data analysis and survey methodology to inform the understanding of potential bias in the outputs of ALS surveys of afforested landscapes. By understanding this phenomenon at a local scale, the reliability of the data can be estimated. Given the nationwide availability of forestry data across Europe, as well as extensive coverage of historic maps, the results discussed in this article have a general application. Focusing on areas with the highest survival potential can lead to immediate discovery of premodern monuments, and hence prevent them from extensive, forestry management related, destruction. {\copyright} 2020 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

 abstract = {The local climate zones (LCZ) scheme has attracted the interest of climate researchers as it enables the standardized study of urban heat islands by combining thermal and physical parameters of built and natural structures. Most recent work on LCZ has concentrated on understanding air temperature differences, adapting the scheme to different contexts and improving satellite-based classification methods. However, studies using very high-resolution imagery, including 3-D descriptors and analyzing their land surface temperature (LST) variability are scarcer. Since a correct delineation of LCZ implies significant temperature differences among classes, the aims of this study are 1) to test a GIS-based method for the classification of LCZ based on cut-off values valid to the Australian context; and 2) to examine the quality of classifications by analyzing the LST variability among LCZ using high-resolution airborne remote sensing data. Results show that diurnal and nocturnal mean LSTs significantly differ among most LCZs. Welch's ANOVA and subsequent post hoc tests for pairwise comparisons also demonstrate that these differences prevail for 71.8{\%} of zones during the daytime and 73.6{\%} of zones at night. Overall, LCZs A, 8, and 3 are the most distinguishable zones during the daytime and LCZs D, G, 1, 4, and 5 are well differentiated at night. In contrast, LCZs 1 and 4 are the least distinguishable at daytime and LCZs 10, A, and E are not well differentiated at night. The present study has successfully validated the present airborne-based classification method which is contingent on further accuracy assessment and improvements. {\copyright} 2008-2012 IEEE.},

@article{Beach.2019,
 abstract = {We report on a large area of ancient Maya wetland field systems in Belize, Central America, based on airborne lidar survey coupled with multiple proxies and radiocarbon dates that reveal ancient field uses and chronology. The lidar survey indicated four main areas of wetland complexes, including the Birds of Paradise wetland field complex that is five times larger than earlier remote and ground survey had indicated, and revealed a previously unknown wetland field complex that is even larger. The field systems date mainly to the Maya Late and Terminal Classic ($\sim$1,400-1,000 y ago), but with evidence from as early as the Late Preclassic ($\sim$1,800 y ago) and as late as the Early Postclassic ($\sim$900 y ago). Previous study showed that these were polycultural systems that grew typical ancient Maya crops including maize, arrowroot, squash, avocado, and other fruits and harvested fauna. The wetland fields were active at a time of population expansion, landscape alteration, and droughts and could have been adaptations to all of these major shifts in Maya civilization. These wetland-farming systems add to the evidence for early and extensive human impacts on the global tropics. Broader evidence suggests a wide distribution of wetland agroecosystems across the Maya Lowlands and Americas, and we hypothesize the increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane from burning, preparing, and maintaining these field systems contributed to the Early Anthropocene.},

@article{Berger.2017,
 abstract = {This paper focuses on the relationship between remotely-sensed urban site characteristics (USCs) and land surface temperature (LST). Particular emphasis is put on an extensive comparison of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) USCs as potential indicators of the surface urban heat island (UHI) effect and as potential predictors for thermal sharpening applications. Both widely-used as well as more recently proposed metrics of the urban remote sensing literature are investigated within a single experiment. While some of these USCs have already been used earlier, others have never been analyzed before in the context of urban temperature studies. In addition to the comparison of 2D and 3D USCs, the spatio-temporal dependencies of their relation to LST are examined. To this end, the experimental setup of this work includes two study areas, 26 USCs, and 16 LST scenes covering four seasons. Use is made of a comprehensive database compiled for the cities of Berlin and Cologne, Germany. After data preparation, very high resolution (VHR) multi-spectral and height data are employed to map fine-scale urban land cover (LC). The resulting LC maps are then used in conjunction with the height information to compute 2D and 3D USCs. Subsequently, multi-temporal LST images are retrieved from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) scenes. The spatio-temporal investigation of the USC--LST connection constitutes the final stage of the workflow and is achieved in the framework of a dedicated correlation analysis. The results of this study highlight that the linkage between USCs and LST sensed at small scan angles is not stronger when 3D parameters are considered. Even though they may offer more holistic representations of the urban landscape, 3D USCs are consistently outperformed by some of the most widely-used 2D metrics. The analysis of spatial dependencies reveals that the USC--LST interplay does not only differ between, but also within the two test sites. This is due to their distinct geographies, with urban form and compactness, green spaces and street trees, and the structural composition of LC elements being some of the determining factors. The examination of temporal dependencies yielded that the association between USCs and LST is fairly stable over time but can be subject to larger inter- and intra-season variations for different reasons, including the season of acquisition, vegetation phenology, and meteorological conditions. Since previous research was based on the analysis of a single study area, a limited number of (mainly 2D) USCs, and/or only a few LST scenes acquired in specific seasons, it is concluded that the findings of this study provide researchers and practitioners with a more complete picture of the USC--LST relationship. {\copyright} 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Bernardini.2020,
 abstract = {This paper presents the results of a research aimed at investigating by airborne LiDAR the ancient landscape of a sector of central northern Istria (Croatia) from prehistory to Roman times. The area, approximately corresponding to the territory of Oprtalj/Portole, is located in a strategic position just north of the mid--Mirna/Quieto river, an important waterway connecting coastal Istria with the inlands since prehistory. The elaboration of high-definition LiDAR data compared with aerial and satellite images, historical cartography and field surveys allowed us to identify unreported prehistoric and Roman features and also get detailed topographic information about already known sites. Beside a few protohistoric hill forts discovered in the past, an open-air Neolithic or Copper Age site, a probable Bronze Age burial mound and three small protohistoric fortifications have been identified. These hill forts are clustered around a north-south valley, which represents a preferential access route from the larger Mirna valley to the karst plateau north of Oprtalj/Portole. In the same plateau, small Roman buildings associated with enclosures and probable artificial ponds have been interpreted as remains of farmsteads related to small-scale herding and agricultural activities. In the southern sector of the investigated area, consisting of marls, sandstones and fertile soils, large scatters of archaeological materials sometimes associated to outcropping features are probably the remains of larger structures characterized by a well-developed agricultural economy. Particularly interesting is the identification of fossil rectilinear land division features that overlap with the cardines of Istrian centuriation. Before our study, centuriation was identified only in the territories of Pore{\v{c}}/Parenzo and Pula/Pola, hence believed not to extend beyond the Mirna river. The new evidence revealed by LiDAR and satellite images, however, shows that a large part of central and northern Istria, between the Mirna and the Dragonja rivers, was divided by the same grid. Based on these considerations, the archaeological evidence here presented makes the Istrian peninsula one of the largest areas in the entire Roman world to have undergone a single planned land division survey. {\copyright} 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

@article{Bessafi.2018,
 abstract = {Many small island developing states are adopting solar photovoltaic technologies as a solution to curtail their overreliance on fossil fuels. Some of these islands are young and of volcanic origin, characterised by intricate topographic heterogeneity. Since they are mostly small, flat land is scarce and valuable. As a result, solar photovoltaic projects are usually developed at sites with complex terrain where frequent changes in elevation, slope and shadows cast by topographic features can significantly attenuate the amount of solar irradiance received. The existence of strong local solar radiation gradients on such islands implies that any solar resource assessment must be performed at a small enough spatial and temporal resolution in order to provide a reliable basis for investment decisions. Ground-based measurements of solar irradiance are accurate but are widely dispersed geographically. Although satellite-derived solar resource data have better spatial and temporal resolution than those recorded by radiometric stations, they are less accurate. Moreover, their spatial resolution is still too large with respect to the small size of the islands. In this work, a downscaling methodology is used to derive monthly and annual average global solar irradiance maps at a resolution of 250 m $\times$ 250 m using satellite hourly datasets, spanning over the period 1999 to 2015 and having a spatial resolution of 0.05° $\times$ 0.05°. The combined effects of horizon blocking and sky obstruction resulting from heterogeneous topography are considered by applying a binary blocking factor and sky view factor respectively. The downscaled maps are then refined by convolving them with ground-based measurements through a kriging procedure. The methodology is validated using leave-one-out kriging procedure and illustrated successfully with the case of Reunion Island, where strong local gradients of solar irradiance were easily distinguished in regions marked by uneven topographic features. {\copyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {Relict charcoal hearths (RCHs) are anthropogenic geomorphic features with an average diameter of 12 m found in many forests of Central Europe and in the eastern USA wherever pre-coal iron production took place or other industries demanded the production of charcoal. To expand the knowledge about their geoarchaeological significance and their legacy effect on soil properties and forest ecosystems, we propose a method for a generalized description of soil stratigraphy on RCHs. We studied 154 soil profiles at 52 RCH sites alongside two 1 km transects in Litchfield County, Connecticut, USA. The sites can be classified based on the slope inclination, with sites on {\textless}4° mostly having a single-layered stratigraphy and an elevated circular shape, while sites on slopes {\textgreater}4° mostly are built as levelled and multilayered platforms. The latter have two or more charcoal rich technogenic Auh-layers separated by intermediate Auh-layers mostly consisting of mineral substrate. Based on average layer thicknesses and their dependence on the sites slope inclinations, we propose a model with two idealized RCH shapes with slope controlled properties that allow for an easy computation of site diameters and elemental stocks. With ongoing advances in remote sensing of RCH sites, our proposed model can help to further understand the effects of historic land use on a landscape scale. {\copyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {Due to complicated backgrounds and unclear target orientation, automated object detection is difficult in the field of archaeology. Most of the current convolutional neural network (CNN) object-oriented detection techniques are based on a faster region-based CNN (R-CNN) and other one-stage detectors that often lack adequate processing speeds and detection accuracies. Recently, the two-stage detector Mask R-CNN technique achieved impressive results in object detection and instance segmentation problems and was successfully applied in the analysis of archaeological airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. In this study, we outline a modified Mask R-CNN technique that reliably and efficiently detects relict charcoal hearth (RCH) sites on light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data-based digital elevation models (DEMs). Using image augmentation and image preprocessing steps combined with the deep learning-based adaptive gradient method with a dynamic bound on the learning rate (AdaBound) optimization technique, we could improve the model's accuracy and significantly reduce its training time. We use DEMs based on high-resolution LiDAR data and the visualization for archaeological topography (VAT) technique that give images with a very strong contrast of the terrain and the outline of the sites of interest in the North German Lowland. Therefore, the model can identify RCH sites with an average recall of 83{\%} and an average precision of 87{\%}. Techniques such as the modified Mask R-CNN method outlined here will help to greatly improve our knowledge about archaeological site densities in the realm of historical charcoal production and past human-landscape interactions. This method provides an accurate, time-efficient and bias-free large-scale site mapping option not only for the North German Lowland but potentially for other landscapes as well. {\copyright} 2021 The Authors.

We used a data set from Pacunam LiDAR Initiative survey of lowland Maya region in Guatemala. The data set contains ancient Maya structures that were manually labeled, and ground verified to a large extent. We have built and compared two deep learning-based models, U-Net and Mask R-CNN, for semantic segmentation. The segmentation models were used in two tasks: identification of areas of ancient construction activity, and identification of the remnants of ancient Maya buildings. The U-Net based model performed better in both tasks and was capable of correctly identifying 60--66{\%} of all objects, and 74--81{\%} of medium sized objects. The quality of the resulting prediction was evaluated using a variety of quantifiers. Furthermore, we discuss the problems of re-purposing the archaeological style labeling for production of valid machine learning training sets. Ultimately, we outline the value of these models for archaeological research and present the road map to produce a useful decision support system for recognition of ancient objects in LiDAR data. {\copyright} 2020 by the authors.

Even if in several occasions modern agricultural activities contributed to the discoveries, bringing to the surface artifacts and scrapes of buried layers, this kind of impact has also been progressively deteriorating the archaeological record, hence the proto-historic landscape is now discernible through evanescent marks which cannot be always detected using customary optical sensors.

 abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) building change detection is important for megacities for updating geo-databases, urban sprawl monitoring, disaster assessments and energy budgets. However, few studies examine how to execute the transition of multi-level change monitoring of urban buildings from 2D to 3D. This study presents a new automated Object--Grid--City Block 3D building change detection (OGB) approach that entails the application of multi-temporal aerial Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. First, building labels at various phases were performed using a graph cuts algorithm to assist with 3D change detection of buildings. Then, we introduced a bi-threshold model to consider and capture trajectories of building change broken down into categories from 1 to 5 and obtain a complete 3D change detection map. In order to reveal the vertical building landscape changes, a set of 3D building landscape metrics was developed for block level change monitoring. Upon examination, the results for the northern part of Brooklyn, New York, USA were confirmed to be robust and refined; the completeness, correctness, and quality values for trajectories 1--5 were 92--95{\%}, 93--97{\%}, 89--95{\%}, respectively. More importantly, the OGB approach can not only effectively monitor intensity, direction (increase or decrease), and spatial pattern changes in 2D and 3D morphological parameters of buildings at the grid level, but can also reflect vertical changes in building structures, and reveal horizontal fragmentations and aggregations of buildings at the block level. {\copyright} 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

However, few studies have reported the extraction of 3D buildings at different scales in urban areas or developed a method for accuracy evaluation. This study aims at developing a method of multi-scale 3D building information extraction (MS3DB) to fill this research gap. Surface flatness and the variance in the normal direction were extracted from the point cloud data, and gray-level co-occurrence matrix was extracted from normalized digital surface models as labeling features, which were fused into a graph-cut the algorithm to determine building labeling. In addition, 2D and 3D building morphological parameters were extracted at the grid-scale, and a set of 3D building landscape metrics were designed at the city-block scale. Accuracy of the extraction of 3D building information was evaluated at the object, grid, and block scales. The model achieved high accuracy in extracting the building labels using data from the northern part of Brooklyn, New York, USA. The results show that the MS3DB method yields limited accuracy in extracting the building edges, whereas other parameters (e.g., area, volume, and planar area index) were extracted with high accuracy at the grid scale (R2~{\&}gt;~0.92). The block-scale landscape analysis shows the advantages of integrating 2D and 3D features (e.g., differences in the vertical landscape) in characterizing the structure of urban buildings and exhibits moderate accuracy (R2~{\&}gt;~0.79). {\copyright} 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

In the case of undocumented immigrants in the Sonoran Desert, such conditions are manipulated by way of surveillance and policing. These conditions, in combination with physical exertion, augment a physiological stress response that coalesces with existing traumas and fear. We undertake a critical mapping of relations among enforcement infrastructure, migration routes, and measurable features of the physical landscape to demonstrate that a corridor in the region functions as a labyrinth, an outcome of a combination of threats and stressors determined by the spaces migrants find themselves in after crossing the U.S./Mexico border. We argue a biopolitical understanding of current border policies indicates it reduces migrants to bare life rather than using threat, stressors, or trauma as instruments for manipulating behavior. We discuss how this labyrinth works in combination with other mechanisms, including criminalization, detention, abuse, separation, and deportation, to deliver consequences that may deter migration. Despite these efforts, migration routes remain plastic, indicating the continued potential to resist and evade the surveillance technologies and enforcement deployed in the borderlands. We assert that an inevitable result of the desert labyrinth is human mortality. {\copyright} 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

@article{Chase.2016,
 abstract = {The Classic Period Maya (300 CE to 900 CE) built many of their cities away from standing, flowing, or subterranean water resources. Because of this, scholars have suggested that one key manifestation of ancient Maya ritual and political authority was the control and management of water housed in large central-site reservoirs, rectilinear excavated features that were lined with stone and coated with plaster or clay to catch and store rainfall runoff. This research assesses those arguments by using remote sensing data to map residential reservoirs---smaller versions of the monumental reservoirs in city centers---from the intensively investigated city of Caracol, Belize. The Caracol Maya were entirely dependent on rainfall and built monumental and residential reservoirs throughout their city. Using a 200-square kilometer Digital Elevation Model created from LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data, research uncovered the extent of ancient water capture at Caracol. Analysis of the LiDAR data reveals a conservative count of 1590 reservoirs at Caracol; this is more than 25 times the number of reservoirs identified by traditional ground survey methods. These data demonstrate how the people of Caracol were able to successfully harness the water available in their environment. In addition, the decentralized nature of Caracol's reservoirs suggests that elite power, at least in this ancient city, was not based on control of water resources due to the ubiquity of residential reservoirs throughout the site.

@article{Chen.2019,
 abstract = {Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) datasets with a large volume pose a great challenge to the traditional interpolation methods for the production of digital terrain models (DTMs). Thus, a fast, global interpolation method based on thin plate spline (TPS) is proposed in this paper. In the methodology, a weighted version of finite difference TPS is first developed to deal with the problem of missing data in the grid-based surface construction. Then, the interpolation matrix of the weighted TPS is deduced and found to be largely sparse. Furthermore, the values and positions of each nonzero element in the matrix are analytically determined. Finally, to make full use of the sparseness of the interpolation matrix, the linear system is solved with an iterative manner. These make the new method not only fast, but also require less random-access memory. Tests on six simulated datasets indicate that compared to recently developed discrete cosine transformation (DCT)-based TPS, the proposed method has a higher speed and accuracy, lower memory requirement, and less sensitivity to the smoothing parameter. Real-world examples on 10 public and 1 private dataset demonstrate that compared to the DCT-based TPS and the locally weighted interpolation methods, such as linear, natural neighbor (NN), inverse distance weighting (IDW), and ordinary kriging (OK), the proposed method produces visually good surfaces, which overcome the problems of peak-cutting, coarseness, and discontinuity of the aforementioned interpolators. More importantly, the proposed method has a similar performance to the simple interpolation methods (e.g., IDW and NN) with respect to computing time and memory cost, and significantly outperforms OK. Overall, the proposed method with low memory requirement and computing cost offers great potential for the derivation of DTMs from large-scale LiDAR datasets. {\copyright} 2019 by the authors.},

 abstract = {Since more than ten years, researches about stone remains under forest have been carried out in the Ch{\^a}tillonnais (C{\^o}te-d'Or, France). he surveys carried out up to date consisted of a systematic GNSS survey of the archaeological features. hese surveys were completed in 2012 by a LiDAR acquisition over 400km 2 , funded by Parcs Nationaux de France (PNF). his paper aims to present the approach developed within the project to process and record the archaeological data detected with the LiDAR. he challenge is to homogenize the vectorization and the recording of each identiied structures (from the sets of images derived from the LiDAR data) by the diferent researchers. For the implementation of this method, a test of vectorization was realized on the same geographical area by eight researchers. he aim of this test is to identify the vectorization biases and to propose a methodological process associating the visualization indexes used, the type of remains to be detected and their topographic location and recording methodology (spatial database, tools of vectorization, etc.) connected to the survey methodology.

 abstract = {The rocky intertidal zone is a highly dynamic and thermally variable ecosystem, where the combined influences of solar radiation, air temperature and topography can lead to differences greater than 15°C over the scale of centimetres during aerial exposure at low tide. For most intertidal organisms this small-scale heterogeneity in microclimates can have enormous influences on survival and physiological performance. However, the potential ecological importance of environmental heterogeneity in determining ecological responses to climate change remains poorly understood. We present a novel framework for generating spatially explicit models of microclimate heterogeneity and patterns of thermal physiology among interacting organisms. We used drone photogrammetry to create a topographic map (digital elevation model) at a resolution of 2 $\times$ 2~cm from an intertidal site in Massachusetts, which was then fed into to a model of incident solar radiation based on sky view factor and solar position. These data were in turn used to drive a heat budget model that estimated hourly surface temperatures over the course of a year (2017). Body temperature layers were then converted to thermal performance layers for organisms, using thermal performance curves, creating 'physiological landscapes' that display spatially and temporally explicit patterns of 'microrefugia'. Our framework shows how non-linear interactions between these layers lead to predictions about organismal performance and survivorship that are distinct from those made using any individual layer (e.g. topography, temperature) alone. We propose a new metric for quantifying the 'thermal roughness' of a site (RqT, the root mean square of spatial deviations in temperature), which can be used to quantify spatial and temporal variability in temperature and performance at the site level. These methods facilitate an exploration of the role of micro-topographic variability in driving organismal vulnerability to environmental change using both spatially explicit and frequency-based approaches.},

 abstract = {An active gully-related landslide system is located in a deep valley under forest canopy cover. Generally, point clouds from forested areas have a lack of data connectivity, and optical parameters of scanning cameras lead to different densities of point clouds. Data noise or systematic errors (missing data) make the automatic identification of landforms under tree canopy problematic or impossible. We processed, analyzed, and interpreted data from a large-scale landslide survey, which were acquired by the light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology, remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS), and close-range photogrammetry (CRP) using the `Structure-from-Motion' (SfM) method. LAStools is a highly efficient Geographic Information System (GIS) tool for point clouds pre-processing and creating precise digital elevation models (DEMs). The main landslide body and its landforms indicating the landslide activity were detected and delineated in DEM-derivatives. Identification of micro-scale landforms in precise DEMs at large scales allow the monitoring and the assessment of these active parts of landslides that are invisible in digital terrain models at smaller scales (obtained from aerial LiDAR or from RPAS) due to insufficient data density or the presence of many data gaps. {\copyright} 2019 by the authors.

While previous studies have explored the relationship between the urban heat islands and 2D urban features, the interactions with 3D urban features and neighboring surface characteristics have not been adequately explored. This paper specifies the impacts of these urban features on the urban heat islands intensity during daytime and nighttime, which tend to be quite different. The empirical evidence from this study suggests that while vegetation is the dominant factor for urban heat islands intensity during daytime, the urban canyon has stronger impacts on the urban heat islands than vegetation at night. In addition adjacent surfaces are more likely to influence nighttime surface temperatures. These results could be used to develop urban design solutions for mitigating the urban heat islands. {\copyright} The Author(s) 2015.},

@article{Chun.2018,
 abstract = {Intensive urbanization has led to the depletion of vegetation and its replacement by impervious surfaces, resulting in the accumulation of thermal energy, with urban areas becoming warmer than peripheral areas, a phenomenon known as the Urban Heat Island (UHI). Much of the literature has focused on the relationship between the UHI and urban factors at peak summer times, without considering seasonality effects. There is, however, clear evidence that the UHI varies over the year, with implications for greening mitigation strategies, as green spaces are known to help reduce summer local temperatures, but also reduce exposure to winter cold, thus increasing local winter temperatures. Both effects are likely to generate, in varying extents, benefits in terms of better health and reduced energy usage and pollution emissions. This paper addresses the seasonality of the impacts of building rooftop and fa{\c{c}}ade areas, urban canyons, water bodies, vegetation, and solar radiation, on UHI intensity. In a case study of the central area of Columbus, Ohio, these various 2D and 3D inputs, as well as land surface temperatures estimated with remotely-sensed imagery, are captured within a spatial grid, and used in spatial regression analyses. The estimation results confirm the opposite effects of greenery, measured by the NDVI, on summer and winter temperatures. The estimated models are then used to simulate the seasonal changes in temperatures resulting from a potential urban greening strategy involving green roofs, the greening of parking lots and other vacant spaces, and vegetation densification. The results show that increased greenery reduces temperatures in summer and increases them in winter, thus demonstrating that greening and land-use policies designed to mitigate the UHI must account for seasonal effects to achieve year-long effectiveness. {\copyright} 2018},

 abstract = {An airborne LiDAR survey of the Nan MadolWorld Heritage Site and adjacent Temwen Island revealed a complex, irrigated cultivation system, the first found in the Central and Eastern Caroline Islands. This informs the goals of the sustainable conservation project, funded by the U.S. Department of State Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation, that inspired the survey, and expands understanding of Nan Madol and its place in the network of Pacific island interaction and trade. Fieldwork verified the presence, across Temwen, of low, wet, cultivable areas, many of which are connected by water channels or separated by earthen berms. The berms themselves may also have been cultivated. In complexity, labor investment, and organization, the system is comparable to Nan Madol itself, the largest archaeological site in Micronesia, with structures on about 100 artificial islets built of stone and coral on a reef flat. Constructed over a millennium, Nan Madol was the seat of the Saudeleur Dynasty, which persisted from about 1200 to 1600 CE. The cultivation system appears to have been able to provide ample food for consumption, feasting, and redistribution or trade. If the landscape alteration described here proves to date to the time of the Saudeleur Dynasty, it will offer many avenues of research into the economic basis of Nan Madol's regional dominance. {\copyright} 2019 by the authors.},

In particular, the information is very scarce for the period between the 2nd century BCE and 1st century CE, when these territories were conquered and integrated into the Roman world. This work presents new Roman military sites discovered through an integrated methodology involving an intensive application of remote sensing techniques in order to provide information to foster a paradigm shift in this field of study. Distributed over a wide geographical area and displaying a wide morpho-typological and locational diversity, this new archaeological evidence not only reflects the ability of the Roman army to adapt to local natural and cultural environments, but also reveals a major operational and logistical assortment that may relate to the diachronic nature of the military presence in the region.},

 abstract = {The Malin Shelf, off north-west Ireland, was an important zone of confluence for marine-based ice streams of the former British--Irish Ice Sheet (BIIS). Legacy geophysical datasets are used to construct models of the seismic character, relative age and distribution of shelf sediments and landforms. Buried and surface landform assemblages provide evidence that during deglaciation of the Late Devensian BIIS, the region was occupied not by a single Hebrides Ice Stream as previously proposed, but by four discrete ice streams, here referred to as the Sea of the Hebrides (SHIS), Inner Hebrides, North Channel and Tory Island ice streams. Our observations of stratigraphic relationships between the deposits of these ice streams indicate physical interactions between them during shelf deglaciation. We interpret an initial dominant cross-shelf flow along the SHIS impeding cross-shelf ice flow from other ice sheet sectors. Following withdrawal of the SHIS grounding line from the shelf edge to mid-shelf bathymetric highs during deglaciation, a reconfiguration of ice sheet flow paths allowed the expansion of smaller cross-shelf ice streams draining central Scotland and north-western Ireland. This internal dynamic behaviour provides a possible physical analogue for time-transgressive flow patterns reported for outlets draining the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. {\copyright} 2021 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

 abstract = {In an effort to characterize the fast neutron radiation background, 16 EJ-309 liquid scintillator cells were installed in the Radiological Multi-sensor Analysis Platform (RadMAP) to collect data in the San Francisco Bay Area. Each fast neutron event was associated with specific weather metrics (pressure, temperature, absolute humidity) and GPS coordinates. The expected exponential dependence of the fast neutron count rate on atmospheric pressure was demonstrated and event rates were subsequently adjusted given the measured pressure at the time of detection. Pressure adjusted data was also used to investigate the influence of other environmental conditions on the neutron background rate. Using National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) coastal area lidar data, an algorithm was implemented to approximate sky-view factors (the total fraction of visible sky) for points along RadMAPs route. Three areas analyzed in San Francisco, Downtown Oakland, and Berkeley all demonstrated a suppression in the background rate of over 50{\%} for the range of sky-view factors measured. This effect, which is due to the shielding of cosmic-ray produced neutrons by surrounding buildings, was comparable to the pressure influence which yielded a 32{\%} suppression in the count rate over the range of pressures measured. {\copyright} 2017},

 abstract = {High resolution digital terrain models (DTMs) generated from airborne LiDAR data and supplemented by field evidence are used to map glacial landform assemblages dating from the last glaciation (Midlandian glaciation; OI stages 2--3) in the central Irish Midlands. The DTMs reveal previously unrecognised low-amplitude landforms, including crevasse-squeeze ridges and mega-scale glacial lineations overprinted by conduit fills leading to ice-marginal subaqueous deposits. We interpret this landform assemblage as evidence for surging behaviour during ice recession. The data indicate that two separate phases of accelerated ice flow were followed by ice sheet stagnation during overall deglaciation. The second surge event was followed by a subglacial outburst flood, forming an intricate esker and crevasse-fill network. The data provide the first clear evidence that ice flow direction was eastward along the eastern watershed of the Shannon River basin, at odds with previous models, and raise the possibility that an ice stream existed in this area. Our work demonstrates the potential for airborne LiDAR surveys to produce detailed paleoglaciological reconstructions and to enhance our understanding of complex palaeo-ice sheet dynamics. {\copyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {The world's largest fossil oyster reef, formed by the giant oyster Crassostrea gryphoides and located in Stetten (north of Vienna, Austria), is studied in this article. Digital documentation of the unique geological site is provided by terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) at the millimeter scale. Obtaining meaningful results is not merely a matter of data acquisition with a suitable device; it requires proper planning, data management, and postprocessing. Terrestrial laser scanning technology has a high potential for providing precise 3D mapping that serves as the basis for automatic object detection in different scenarios; however, it faces challenges in the presence of large amounts of data and the irregular geometry of an oyster reef. We provide a detailed description of the techniques and strategy used for data collection and processing. The use of laser scanning provided the ability to measure surface points of 46,840 (estimated) shells. They are up to 60-cm-long oyster specimens, and their surfaces are modeled with a high accuracy of 1 mm. In addition, we propose an automatic analysis method for identifying and enumerating convex parts of shells. Object surfaces were detected with a completeness of 69{\%} and a correctness of over 75{\%} by means of a fully automated workflow. Accuracy of 98{\%} was achieved in detecting the number of objects. In addition to laser scanning measurements, more than 300 photographs were captured, and an orthophoto mosaic was generated with a ground sampling distance (GSD) of 0.5 mm. This high-resolution 3D information and the photographic texture serve as the basis for ongoing and future geological and paleontological analyses. Moreover, they provide unprecedented documentation for conservation issues at a unique natural heritage site. {\copyright} 2016 The Authors.},

 abstract = {For many decades the villa maritima of Vi{\v{z}}ula had been considered as one of the largest of its kind in Istria, Croatia. In order to prove this theory, large-scale archaeological prospection was applied in Vi{\v{z}}ula from 2014 onwards, including geophysics (Ground Penetrating Radar) and remote sensing (Airborne Laser Scanning/Airborne Laser Bathymetry). Integrating the results of these non-invasive techniques with terrestrial and underwater surveys and excavations provided an opportunity to evaluate this architecture from a different perspective. Our research indicates that instead of a single luxurious residence, several contemporary complexes existed on Vi{\v{z}}ula, namely two villae maritimae and two villae rusticae. Furthermore, the results show that the combined methodology is able to integrate detail and context into an interpretative coherent model of a landscape going far beyond the analytical capabilities of each individual method. {\copyright} 2020 Verlag der Oesterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften.

 abstract = {In the framework of Portuguese radio astronomical capacitation towards participation in the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) project, a site was selected for radio astronomical testing purposes and the development of a radio astronomical infrastructure. The site is within Herdade da Contenda (HC), a large national forest perimeter, located in Alentejo (Portugal). In order to minimize the impacts in the ecosystem and landscape, an application based on the Geographic Information System (GIS) open source environment was created, the HC Environmental Integrated Management System. This application combines several functionalities and menus with different characterization methods allowing the creation of multiple maps regarding the HC characteristics, such as Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Land Use Land Cover (LULC), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), groundwater vulnerability, erosion risk, flood risk and forest fire risk. Other geographical information can be added if necessary (human heritage visualization and fauna and flora). A decision making support tool was also developed. It incorporates an algorithm running through a series of assigned weights and eliminatory factors to find the locations best suited for the infrastructure with minimal impact to the local ecosystem. In order to test the application and the decision making tool, several maps were used as input in order to decide which sites are more adequate. The application developed can be adopted for other protected or natural areas. {\copyright} 2016 ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information. All Rights Reserved.},

@article{Dubel.2017,
 abstract = {In 3D terrain analysis, topographical characteristics, such as mountains or valleys, and geo-spatial data characteristics, such as specific weather conditions or objects of interest, are important features. Visual representations of these features are essential in many application fields, e.g., aviation, meteorology, or geo-science. However, creating suitable representations is challenging. On the one hand, conveying the topography of terrain models is difficult, due to data complexity and computational costs. On the other hand, depicting further geo-spatial data increases the intricacy of the image and can lead to visual clutter. Moreover, perceptional issues within the 3D presentation, such as distance recognition, play a significant role as well. In this paper, we address the question of how features in the terrain can be visualized appropriately. We discuss various design options to facilitate the awareness of global and local features; that is, the coarse spatial distribution of characteristics and the fine-granular details. To improve spatial perception of the 3D environment, we propose suitable depth cues. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by a sophisticated framework called TEDAVIS that unifies the proposed concepts and facilitates designing visual terrain representations tailored to user requirements. {\copyright} 2017 by the authors.},

 abstract = {Remotely sensed Land Surface Temperature (LST) is of paramount importance in numerous environmental applications. Although, coarse spatial resolution sensors provide frequent LST measurements, their applicability is rather limited for many applications. Downscaling methods are therefore applied to improve the spatial resolution of LST products. A number of Machine Learning (ML) methods have already been used in the LST downscaling studies. Nevertheless, the literature lacks a suitable inter-comparison of different ML methods, as well as the impact of the feature selection process on downscaling results. This study aims at comparing downscaled LST from 1 km daily MODIS LST product (MOD11A1) to 240 m using Random Forest Regression (RFR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Temperature Sharpening (TsHARP) approaches with 11 predictor variables at a heterogeneous area in different seasons. In addition, by implementing a feature selection with the Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) method, the most important variables were selected and used as inputs of the models. The results were evaluated against the LST derived from Landsat-8 thermal imageries using a split window method, showing that all the ML methods perform well in LST downscaling (with an average RMSE = 2.5 and MAE = 1.74) with marginal differences, outperforming the TsHARP method (RMSE$\sim$ 3.02, MAE$\sim$ 2.19). Among all the methods, ELM required the least computational effort, and when it was combined with SVM-RFE, general efficiency of the downscaling procedure was increased substantially. {\copyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {In the Netherlands awareness regarding the Urban Heat Island (UHI) was raised relatively recently. Because of this recent understanding, there is a lack of consistent urban micro-meteorological measurements to allow a conventional UHI assessment of Dutch cities during heat waves. This paper argues that it is possible to retrieve relevant UHI information---including adaptation guidelines---from satellite imagery. The paper comprises three parts. The first part consists of a study of suited indicators to identify urban heat islands from which a method is presented based on ground heat flux mapping. The second part proposes heat mitigation strategies and identifies the areas where these strategies could be applied within the hotspots identified in the cities of The Hague, Delft, Leiden, Gouda, Utrecht and Den Bosch. The third part estimates the reduction of urban heat generated by the increase of roof albedo in the hotspots of the six cities. The six cities hotspots are located within the boundaries of the seventeenth century city centres. In order to avoid interference with cultural values of these historical environments most likely UHI mitigation measures regard improving the thermal behaviour of the city roofs. For instance, applying white coatings on bitumen flat roofs (or replacing them by white single-ply membranes) and replacing sloped roof clay tiles by coloured tiles with cool pigments can reduce the urban heat hotspots by approximately 1.5~°C. Remote sensing provides high level information that provide urban planners and policy makers with overall design guidelines for the reduction of urban heat. {\copyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

 abstract = {Visibility analysis has become extremely popular in landscape-oriented archaeology in recent decades and has become even more widespread with the popularization of GIS tools, which have multiplied the ways in which visual perception can be analysed and digitally modelled. Visibility has been used as a proxy for different archaeological approaches, from the analysis of subjective perception to the assessment of strategic control. While interest has most often been focused on how objects, features and sites are perceived, there has also been an interest in how visual control is exerted from archaeological sites or other places in the landscape. Within the latter approaches, the distances at which visual control can be exercised have usually been determined in a more or less arbitrary manner, without a clear and empirically informed reference on how things and, especially, people can be observed and recognized differently at a distance. In this paper, we present the results of a field experiment carried out to measure the distances at which individuals can be spotted, recognized and identified with the naked eye in favourable conditions. Based on these results, we introduce the concept of Individual Distance Viewshed (IDV) as a GIS-based representation of visual control. This will serve as a reference to better qualify potential visibility in landscape analysis. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of this approach with a case study which explores the relationship between visual control and mobility during the Iron Age in the NW of the Iberian Peninsula. {\copyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {In contrast to the input perspective for evaluating planning metrics, this research takes the climatic environmental output effects as the starting point for assessing ecological city construction. Based on approaches such as observation data analysis, meteorological model simulation, and remote sensing, a set of climatic environmental performance assessment methods is developed and established. These methods mainly focus on surface ventilation assessment and urban thermal environment assessment. With the Yanqi Lake ecological development demonstration area located in Huairou district, Beijing as an example, the assessment of the local climatic environment before and after the construction are conducted, and relevant policy suggestions for urban planning and construction are presented. The results show that after development, the ventilation capacity will decrease overall and the ventilation potential index will decrease from 0.53 to 0.44. While this is not a large reduction, and is still at a favorable level, the ventilation potential in some local areas will markedly decrease. Furthermore, the thermal environment will become poorer to some extent; the urban heat island (UHI) area and intensity will increase compared with the current situation; continuous heat islands may occur in local areas; the UHI potential index of the core area will rise from 0.0878 to 0.1217 (still a favorable level). Therefore, urban surfaces should be carefully developed and arranged during planning. It is suggested that the negative impacts of large areas of urban construction on the local climatic environment in the Yanqi Lake could be mitigated by 1) strengthening the airflow by introducing fresh, cold, northwesterly air via constructed ventilation corridors, 2) increasing the number of ecological cold sources, particularly for water bodies and green belts to prevent the UHI in the southern region of Yanqi Lake from becoming linked with each other, and 3) considering a pre-program before sub-domain and building planning to obtain optimum building locations. Different construction standards should be developed for different ventilation potential and UHI intensity levels. For strong heat island areas, land areas should be reserved to serve as cold sources. {\copyright} 2015 National Climate Center (China Meteorological Administration).},

Originally a manual technique, relief shading creates the three-dimensional effect and allows the user to read the terrain in an intuitive way. With the advent of digital elevation models (DEMs) analytical relief shading came into a wider use, since it is faster, requires less effort, and delivers reproducible results. In contrast to manual relief shading, however, it often lacks clarity when representing heterogeneous landscapes with diverse landforms. The aim of this work is to evaluate analytical hillshading methods against a set of landforms within an online survey. The responses revealed that the clear sky model performs best applied to most of the landforms included in the survey, in particular all the mountain and valley types. Cluster shading proved to work well for the mountainous and hilly areas but less so in the depiction of valleys. Texture shading and the multidirectional, obliqueweighted (MDOW) method deliver too much detail for most of the landforms presented. Glaciers were depicted in the best way using the aspect tool. For alluvial fans, the standard relief shading with custom lighting direction proved to work best compared to the other methods. {\copyright} 2020 by the authors.},

 abstract = {Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are fruitfully used in volcanology as the topographic base for mapping and quantifying volcanic landforms. The increasing availability of free topographic data on the web, decreasing production costs for high-accuracy data and advances in computer technology, has triggered rapid growth of the number of DEM users in the volcanological community. DEMs are often visualized only as hill-shaded maps, and while this is among the major advantages in using them, the possibility of deriving a very large number of parameters from a single grid of elevation data makes DEMs a powerful tool for morphometric analysis. However, many of these parameters have almost the same informative content, and before starting to elaborate topographic data it is recommended to know a-priori what parameters best visualize the investigated landform, and therefore what is necessary and what is redundant. In this work, we review a number of analytical procedures used to parameterize and represent DEMs. A LIDAR-derived DEM matrix acquired over the Valle del Bove valley, on Mt. Etna, is used as test-case elevation data for deriving the parameters. We first review well known parameters such as hill-shading, slope and aspect, curvature, and roughness, before extending the review to some less common parameters such as Sky View Factor (SVF), openness, and Red Relief Image Maps (RRIM). For each parameter a description is given emphasizing how it can be used for identifying and delimiting specific volcanic elements. The analyzed surface parameters are then cross-compared in order to infer which of them is most uncorrelated, and the results are represented in the form of a correlation matrix. Finally, the reviewed DEM-derived parameters and the correlation matrix are used for analyzing the volcanic landforms of two case studies: Michoac{\'a}n-Guanajuato volcanic field and a phonolitic lava flow at the Island of Tenerife. {\copyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Favalli.2018,
 abstract = {During an eruption, time scales of topographic change are fast and involve vertical and planimetric evolution of millimeters to meters as the event progresses. Repeat production of high spatial resolution terrain models of lava flow fields over time scales of a few hours is thus a high-value capability in tracking the buildup of the deposit. Among the wide range of terrestrial and aerial methods available to collect such topographic data, the use of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as an acquisition platform, together with structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry, has become especially useful. This approach allows high-frequency production of centimeter-scale terrain models over kilometer-scale areas, including dangerous and inaccessible zones, with low cost and minimal hazard to personnel. This study presents the application of such an integrated UAV-SfM method to generate a high spatial resolution digital terrain model and orthomosaic of Mount Etna's January--February 1974 lava flow field. The SfM method, applied to images acquired using a UAV platform, enabled the extraction of a very high spatial resolution (20~cm) digital elevation model and the generation of a 3-cm orthomosaic covering an area of 1.35~km2. This spatial resolution enabled us to analyze the morphology of sub-meter-scale features, such as folds, blocks, and cracks, over kilometer-scale areas. The 3-cm orthomosaic allowed us to further push the analysis to centimeter-scale grain size distribution of the lava surface. Using these data, we define three types of crust structure and relate them to positions within a channel-fed ʻaʻā flow system. These crust structures are (i) flow parallel shear lines, (ii) raft zones, and (iii) folded zones. Flow parallel shear lines are found at the channel edges, and are 2-m-wide and 0.25-m-deep zones running along the levee base and in which cracking is intense. They result from intense shearing between the moving channel lava and the static levee lava. In zones where initial levees are just beginning to form, these subtle features are the only marker that delimits the moving lava from the stagnant marginal lava. Rafts generally form as the system changes from a stable to a transitional channel regime. Over this 170-m-long zone, the channel broadens from 8 to 70~m and rafts are characterized by topographically higher and poorly cracked areas, surrounded by lower, heavily cracked areas. We interpret the rafts as forming due to breakup of crust zones, previously moving in a coherent manner in the narrow proximal channel reach. Folded zones involve arcuate, cross-flow ridges with their apexes pointing down-flow, where ridges have relatively small clasts and depressions are of coarser-grained breccia. Our folds have wavelengths of 10~m and amplitudes of 1~m; are found towards the flow front, down-flow of the raft zones; and are associated with piling up of lava behind a static or slowly moving flow front. The very high spatial resolution topographic data available from UAV-SfM allow us to resolve surfaces where roughness has a vertical and horizontal scale of variation that is less than 1~m. This is the case over pāhoehoe and ʻaʻā flow surfaces, and thus allows us to explore those new structures that are only apparent in the sub-metric data. Moreover, during future eruptions, the possibility to acquire such information in near-real time will allow a prompt analysis of developing lava flow fields and structures therein, such as developing lava channel systems, so as to contribute to timely hazard assessment, modeling, and projections. {\copyright} 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

 abstract = {This article focuses on the characterization of auriferous deposits, identification of hitherto unknown Roman mining infrastructure remains, and the early attempts of exploitation carried out in north-west Iberia. The research has combined airborne laser scanning (LiDAR) and field prospection to explore the geomorphological signature and landscape transformation resulting from Roman mining works in two unknown sectors of the western Duero Meseta. The integration of geological and remote sensing information contributed to extend the Roman's mining domains, traditionally focused on the river headwaters of the north-west. The article explores the complex hydraulic system developed in the Jamuz and lower sector of the Eria river valleys, as well as the evidence of open-cast mining and their relationship with the Roman army. The results suggest that the highly dispersed and reduced dimensions of the mining sites correspond to a selected method of gold prospection, employed for the identification of viable exploitation sectors. Thus, the initiation of the mining works could have started in the Jamuz valley and developed systematically in this area, to subsequently spread towards the upstream sectors and nearby valleys. This research contributes to gain new insights into the extension and complexity of the mining infrastructure, indicating the importance of the gold-bearing ra{\~n}a deposits within the framework of Roman gold mining in north-west Spain. {\copyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

@article{FernandezLozano.2020,
 abstract = {This study explores the information gathered from the landscape transformation that occurred during the intense period of Roman hydraulic gold mining activity in northwest Spain. The Sierra del Teleno and its surroundings are characterised by the presence of Quaternary glacial and periglacial deposits and, locally, Neogene alluvial sediments, which were intensely mined by the Romans. However, the mining debris often obscures natural deposits, making their identification and description a challenging task. The aim of this study is to determine the existence of specific geomorphological features that can improve the identification of anthropic elements related to mining activity. River captures and widened drainage systems are among the most outstanding structures remaining, due to the extent and complexity of the work involved. However, other mining elements, such as anthropic modification of alluvial fans, moraine deposits and rock ridges are also evident in the landscape. In many cases, these remains are linked to the hydrologic infrastructure found in the area, which mainly comprises an extensive system of natural and man-made channels and distribution water-tanks. Difficulties arise in areas where no such structures are found. Thus, the use of geomorphic elements and patterns can help to distinguish natural and anthropic landforms. Using this approach, therefore, we have performed the first systematic and detailed analysis of the morphological imprint of Roman hydraulic gold mining activity on the landscape. These data will help piece together the puzzle of how the landscape was transformed by Roman mining activity, and can contribute to discussions surrounding the new epoch: The Anthropocene. {\copyright} 2020},

 abstract = {The integration of a spatial process model into an environmental modeling framework can enhance the model's capabilities. This paper describes a general methodology for integrating environmental models into the Object Modeling System (OMS) regardless of the model's complexity, the programming language, and the operating system used. We present the integration of the GEOtop model into the OMS version 3.0 and illustrate its application in a small watershed. OMS is an environmental modeling framework that facilitates model development, calibration, evaluation, and maintenance. It provides innovative techniques in software design such as multithreading, implicit parallelism, calibration and sensitivity analysis algorithms, and cloud-services. GEOtop is a physically based, spatially distributed rainfall-runoffmodel that performs three-dimensional finite volume calculations of water and energy budgets. Executing GEOtop as an OMS model component allows it to: (1) interact directly with the open-source geographical information system (GIS) uDig-JGrass to access geo-processing, visualization, and other modeling components; and (2) use OMS components for automatic calibration, sensitivity analysis, or meteorological data interpolation. A case study of the model in a semi-arid agricultural catchment is presented for illustration and proof-of-concept. Simulated soil water content and soil temperature results are compared with measured data, and model performance is evaluated using goodness-of-fit indices. This study serves as a template for future integration of process models into OMS. {\copyright} 2015 by the authors.},

The recent emergence of national scale remotely sensed datasets has created the potential to greatly increase the rate of analysis and recording of cultural heritage sites. However, the time and resources required to process these datasets in traditional desktop surveys presents a near insurmountable challenge. The use of artificial intelligence to carry out preliminary processing of vast areas could enable experts to prioritize their prospection focus; however, success so far has been hindered by the lack of large training datasets in this field. This study develops an innovative transfer learning approach, utilizing a deep convolutional neural network initially trained on Lunar LiDAR datasets and reapplied here in an archaeological context. Recall rates of 80{\%} and 83{\%} were obtained on the 0.5 m and 0.25 m resolution datasets respectively, with false positive rates maintained below 20{\%}.

 abstract = {Topography alters the vertical structure of the atmosphere and, therefore, its radiative properties regarding the reflection and transmission of the solar radiation. Also it modifies the conditions of illumination of terrain, with remarkable influence in the remote sensing measures of the terrestrial surface in the optical spectrum. In this work we have applied two models of atmospheric and radiometric correction on an ENVISAT/MERIS image, considering the topography, to analyse the importance of such effects. For this, we have exploited the recent rise of Digital Models of Elevation (MDE) sufficiently detailed and precise, available to a global scale, that open new prospects for the topographical corrections of remote sensing data. The results show the adjustment of the conjoint correction model (atmospheric and topographical) in the considered case, improving comparison of spectral signatures of similar surfaces independently of the elevation or the conditions of illumination, compensating the relative variations caused by the topography in the reflectivity measured by sensors. Although the remote sensing of the terrestrial surface has tended traditionally to avoid the bands of atmospheric absorption, a peculiarity that presents the ENVISAT/MERIS images is the availability of a band (O2A) of absorption of the oxygen, located in the 761.5 nm. This band is used mainly for atmospheric corrections (estimate of the surface's pressure, elevation of clouds, aerosols effects, etc.). But also it has been employed recently to determine the fluorescence of the vegetation, consequently this band of absorption has received remarkable attention in the last years. Considering that this absorption of the oxygen is strongly affected for topography, the determination of information on the terrestrial surface from this absorption of the oxygen requires a very precise correction of the topographical effects. Therefore in this work we analyse in particular the effect of the peak of reflectivity at 761.5 nm originated by an inappropriate correction of the topography and we study the existent relationship between the local atmospheric pressure and the depth band of absorption of the oxygen in this wavelength. {\copyright} 2014 Asociacion Espanola de Teledeteccion.

Taking Ganjingzi District, Dalian, as an example, this study considered urban spatial form at the community scale using spatial autocorrelation and spatial regression methods to explore 2003--2018 spatial and temporal differentiation characteristics and driving factors of Land Surface Temperature (LST). The LST of each community showed a gradually increasing trend; high values ({\textgreater}30°C) were concentrated in central and eastern areas; low values were ({\textless}25°C) was concentrated in the south and west. LSTs were influenced by spatial variables (e.g., land use); however, building form was only weakly related to LST. The global autocorrelation Moran's I value for LST exceeded 0.7, indicating strong positive correlation in terms of spatial distribution. H-H and L-L LISA values were distributed in central and southern areas, respectively. The spatial error model (SEM) was a better fit than the spatial lag (SLM) or ordinary least squares models (OLS) and was used to explore these relationships. This study focuses on community surface temperature and hopes to provide a valuable reference for community planning, resource allocation and sustainable development. {\copyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

@article{Guyot.2018,
 abstract = {Airborne LiDAR technology is widely used in archaeology and over the past decade has emerged as an accurate tool to describe anthropomorphic landforms. Archaeological features are traditionally emphasised on a LiDAR-derived Digital Terrain Model (DTM) using multiple Visualisation Techniques (VTs), and occasionally aided by automated feature detection or classification techniques. Such an approach offers limited results when applied to heterogeneous structures (different sizes, morphologies), which is often the case for archaeological remains that have been altered throughout the ages. This study proposes to overcome these limitations by developing a multi-scale analysis of topographic position combined with supervised machine learning algorithms (Random Forest). Rather than highlighting individual topographic anomalies, the multi-scalar approach allows archaeological features to be examined not only as individual objects, but within their broader spatial context. This innovative and straightforward method provides two levels of results: a composite image of topographic surface structure and a probability map of the presence of archaeological structures. The method was developed to detect and characterise megalithic funeral structures in the region of Carnac, the Bay of Quiberon, and the Gulf of Morbihan (France), which is currently considered for inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage List. As a result, known archaeological sites have successfully been geo-referenced with a greater accuracy than before (even when located under dense vegetation) and a ground-check confirmed the identification of a previously unknown Neolithic burial mound in the commune of Carnac. {\copyright} 2018 by the authors.},

 abstract = {Heterogeneous terrain significantly complicates signals received by airborne or satellite sensors. It has been demonstrated that both solar direct beam and diffuse skylight illumination conditions are significant factors influencing the anisotropy of reflectance over mountainous areas. Several models and methods have been developed to account for topographic effects on surface reflectance at the pixel level in remote sensing. However, subtopographic effects are generally neglected for low-spatial-resolution pixels due to the complex law of radiative transfer and the limitations of higher spatial resolution digital elevation models, which can lead to deviations in reflectance estimation. Accurately estimating the subtopographic effects on anisotropic reflectance over composite sloping terrain under different illumination conditions presents a challenge for remote sensing models and applications. In this paper, the diffused equivalent slope model (dESM) was developed, which is an anisotropic reflectance simulation model coupled with diffuse skylight over composite sloping terrain. The corresponding subtopographic impact factor was also proposed to exhibit how microslope topography affects reflectance over composite sloping terrain under different illumination conditions. Simulated reflectance data sets simulated by the radiosity method and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer reflectance data were used to evaluate the performance of the dESM model. The results reveal that the dESM model can accurately capture the reflectance anisotropy over composite sloping terrain under different illumination conditions, and the subtopographic impact factor can account for the effects of microslope topography, shadow, and illumination conditions. {\copyright} 1980-2012 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Topography complicates the modeling and retrieval of land surface albedo due to shadow effects and the redistribution of incident radiation. Neglecting topographic effects may lead to a significant bias when estimating land surface albedo over a single slope. However, for rugged terrain, a comprehensive and systematic investigation of topographic effects on land surface albedo is currently ongoing. Accurately estimating topographic effects on land surface albedo over a rugged terrain presents a challenge in remote sensing modeling and applications. In this paper, we focused on the development of a simplified estimation method for snow-free albedo over a rugged terrain at a 1-km scale based on a 30-m fine-scale digital elevation model (DEM). The proposed method was compared with the radiosity approach based on simulated and real DEMs. The results of the comparison showed that the proposed method provided adequate computational efficiency and satisfactory accuracy simultaneously. Then, the topographic effects on snow-free albedo were quantitatively investigated and interpreted by considering the mean slope, subpixel aspect distribution, solar zenith angle, and solar azimuth angle. The results showed that the more rugged the terrain and the larger the solar illumination angle, the more intense the topographic effects were on black-sky albedo (BSA). The maximum absolute deviation (MAD) and the maximum relative deviation (MRD) of the BSA over a rugged terrain reached 0.28 and 85{\%}, respectively, when the SZA was 60° for different terrains. Topographic effects varied with the mean slope, subpixel aspect distribution, SZA and SAA, which should not be neglected when modeling albedo. {\copyright} 2018 by the authors.},

 abstract = {Comprehensively evaluating the accuracy of the digital elevation model (DEM) upscaling methods is significant for us to choose the DEM upscaling method reasonably, master the DEM upscaling law, and construct a new DEM upscaling model. However, the current researches on DEM accuracy evaluation are still not sufficient to meet the requirements of practical applications. In this paper, an accuracy assessment method for DEM based on energy factor is proposed and then is applied to the accuracy assessment of different DEM upscaling methods. A comprehensive evaluation strategy combining qualitative and quantitative accuracy assessment and quality evaluation methods is constructed to verify the rationality and effectiveness of the assessment strategy based on energy factor. The experimental results show that the accuracy assessment method based on energy factor is simple in theory and is easy to operate in practice. It can reflect the retention characteristics of the terrain masking relationship of the upscaling methods, whereas the traditional precision evaluation strategy cannot reflect them directly. This accuracy assessment framework also provides a new and valuable standard for choosing the DEM upscaling methods, and puts forward new design requirements for the DEM upscaling methods. It also has great influence on remote sensing modeling and inversion. {\copyright} 2019, Research and Development Office of Wuhan University. All right reserved.},

 abstract = {The semiempirical kernel-driven model is commonly used for global surface reflectance characterization because of its simplicity and underlying physical meaning. However, the current kernel-driven reflectance models assume that the terrain is flat and homogeneous, and can induce significant errors in the surface reflectance estimation and subsequent parameter retrievals over rugged terrain. In this study, an improved topography-coupled kernel-driven (TCKD) reflectance model with the correction of diffuse skylight effects was proposed based on the diffused-equivalent slope model (dESM) and RossThick-LiTransit (RTLT) kernel-driven model. The TCKD model's accuracy and effectiveness were evaluated using surface reflectance simulated by the radiosity approach and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Against simulated data, the results show that the TCKD model can accurately capture the distortion of the reflectance shape and hemispherical distribution caused by the topographic effects. Compared to MODIS data, the TCKD model has an overall better performance than the RTLT model across different spatial scales and land cover types. When the mean slope is larger than 35° at the 500-m resolution, the TCKD model's near-infrared (NIR) root-mean-square error (RMSE) and the regression slope of the fitting line are 0.037 and 0.752, respectively, whereas those of the RTLT model are 0.049 and 0.645. Neglecting the diffuse skylight in the TCKD model can also lead to great bias in the reflectance retrievals. When the mean slope is 31°, as the ratio of diffuse skylight varies from 0 to 1, the NIR RMSE of the TCKD model decreases from 0.012 to 0.005, whereas that increases from 0.012 to around 0.02 if the diffuse skylight effects are neglected. These preliminary results demonstrate that the TCKD model is capable of improving the fitting ability of the kernel-driven model over rugged terrain and provides potentials for better retrieving and interpreting land surface parameters such as land surface albedo in mountainous areas. {\copyright} 2019 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Glacier recession driven by climate change produces glacial lakes, some of which are hazardous. Our study assesses the evolution of three of the most hazardous moraine-dammed proglacial lakes in the Nepal Himalaya-Imja, Lower Barun, and Thulagi. Imja Lake (up to 150 m deep; 78.4 $\times$ 106 m3 volume; surveyed in October 2014) and Lower Barun Lake (205 m maximum observed depth; 112.3 $\times$ 106 m3 volume; surveyed in October 2015) are much deeper than previously measured, and their readily drainable volumes are slowly growing. Their surface areas have been increasing at an accelerating pace from a few small supraglacial lakes in the 1950s/1960s to 1.33 km2 and 1.79 km2 in 2017, respectively. In contrast, the surface area (0.89 km2) and volume of Thulagi lake (76 m maximum observed depth; 36.1 $\times$ 106 m3; surveyed in October 2017) has remained almost stable for about two decades. Analyses of changes in the moraine dams of the three lakes using digital elevation models (DEMs) quantifies the degradation of the dams due to the melting of their ice cores and hence their natural lowering rates as well as the potential for glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). We examined the likely future evolution of lake growth and hazard processes associated with lake instability, which suggests faster growth and increased hazard potential at Lower Barun lake. {\copyright} 2018 by the authors.},

 abstract = {The prediction of potential solar energy at candidate sites plays a key role in the search for high solar energy regions to accommodate solar photovoltaic facilities. However, the estimation of solar irradiation can be inaccurate when site conditions are not similar to the ones at observation stations. In particular, regional effects caused by adjacent terrains have rarely been modeled in the estimation process. This study thus presents a digital elevation map-based convolutional neural network modeling method for the prediction of annual solar irradiation under clear-sky conditions. Using map data as an input, the sole impact of neighboring topography on available solar energy can be understood at a large scale. Specifically, with elevation maps and corresponding solar irradiation maps, the mean of solar irradiation values for each map is calculated. This mean value is then used as an output to identify the non-linear and hidden relationship between such values and the input maps in training processes. The proposed network model uses terrain map datasets and hence enables the recognition and learning of complex topographic features and patterns in the datasets. As a result, the network model has a mean absolute percent error of 0.470{\%} for testing datasets. This implies that the topographic patterns on a large scale may coincide with variations of available solar irradiation prior to the effects of weather. Thus, the integration of raster map data with solar energy prediction has emerged to systematically learn the terrain patterns in order to predict the annual amount of solar irradiation in a region of interest. This approach can aid the determination of suitable locations for the installation of solar panels. {\copyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Inter-group and inter-state conflict are one aspect of human behaviour which commonly causes such relief changes. Conflict archaeology and conflict geomorphology, which are both young sub-disciplines within their scientific fields, have until now only touched upon a small part of the wide range of issues which they can encompass. While conflict archaeology has for a long time been almost synonymous with battlefield archaeology, the few papers explicitly discussing conflict geomorphology are mainly concerned with the impact of bombing on soil geomorphology. The application of high-resolution digital elevation models in investigating past conflicts can and should, however, encompass all geomorphological traces of conflict. These include defensive structures such as earthworks, primary and secondary traces of warfare itself (e.g. bomb craters and rubble mountains), conflict-related traces associated with military training and weapons testing facilities as well as, potentially, traces of conflict sustenance (e.g. conflict-related mining and infrastructure). Examples highlight the potential of high-resolution digital elevation models for the detection, mapping and quantification of conflict-related relief changes and thus for the understanding of conflicts. As suitable data are becoming increasingly available, the study of prehistoric and historic conflicts will benefit across the discipline boundaries between archaeology and geomorphology.

 abstract = {Haze is an extreme weather event that can severely increase air pollution exposure, resulting in higher burdens on human health. Few studies have explored the health effects of haze, and none have investigated the spatiotemporal interaction between temperature, air quality and urban environment that may exacerbate the adverse health effects of haze. We investigated the spatiotemporal pattern of haze effects and explored the additional effects of temperature, air pollution and urban environment on the short-term mortality risk during hazy days. We applied a Poisson regression model to daily mortality data from 2007 through 2014, to analyze the short-term mortality risk during haze events in Hong Kong. We evaluated the adverse effect on five types of cause-specific mortality after four types of haze event. We also analyzed the additional effect contributed by the spatial variability of urban environment on each type of cause-specific mortality during a specific haze event. A regular hazy day (lag 0) has higher all-cause mortality risk than a day without haze (odds ratio: 1.029 [1.009, 1.049]). We have also observed high mortality risks associated with mental disorders and diseases of the nervous system during hazy days. In addition, extreme weather and air quality contributed to haze-related mortality, while cold weather and higher ground-level ozone had stronger influences on mortality risk. Areas with a high-density environment, lower vegetation, higher anthropogenic heat, and higher PM2.5 featured stronger effects of haze on mortality than the others. A combined influence of haze, extreme weather/air quality, and urban environment can result in extremely high mortality due to mental/behavioral disorders or diseases of the nervous system. In conclusion, we developed a data-driven technique to analyze the effects of haze on mortality. Our results target the specific dates and areas with higher mortality during haze events, which can be used for development of health warning protocols/systems.},

 abstract = {Temperature is associated with mortality risk across cities. However, there is lack of study investigating the summer effect on mortality associated with mental/behavioral disorders, especially in cities with subtropical~climate. In addition, summer mortality in subtropical cities is different from tropical cities, and previous studies have not investigated the urban environmental inequality on heat mortality associated with mental/behavioral disorders. A register-based study was developed to estimate the temperature effects on decedents on days with 50th percentile of average daily temperature between 2007 and 2014 in Hong Kong (n~= 133,359). Poisson regression was firstly~applied to estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) from the summer temperature effects on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, respiratory mortality, and mortality associated with mental/behavioral disorders. For a 1~°C increase in average temperature~on days with temperature $\geq$ 24.51 °C, IRRs of mortality associated with mental and behavioral disorders on lag 0 and lag 1~days were 1.033 [1.004, 1.062] and 1.030 [1.002, 1.060], while temperature effects on cardiovascular mortality and respiratory mortality during normal summer days (not extreme heat events) were not significant. A further investigation with linear regression has shown that decedents with mental/behavioral disorders on higher temperature days resided in areas with lower percentage of sky view, lower percentage of vegetation cover, higher level of neighborhood-level PM2.5, higher level of neighborhood-level NO, and higher level of neighborhood-level black carbon (BC). In order to develop protocols for community healthcare based on the {\textquotedbl}Leaving no one behind{\textquotedbl} scheme documented in the 2016 Sustainable Development Goals report of the United Nations, it is necessary to include heat effects on mental/behavioral disorders, especially people with dementia, for community planning and healthcare development.},

Previous studies have quantified environmental vulnerability using objective environmental datasets. However, environmental cognition among a population may influence subjective feelings of environmental vulnerability, and this can be associated with community health risk. In this study, a mixed-methods approach was applied to estimate neighborhood-based environmental vulnerability based on objective environmental measures and subjective environmental understanding from a local population. The synergistic use of both qualitative and quantitative data resulted in a {\textquotedbl}subjective environmental vulnerability{\textquotedbl} index which can demonstrate environmental deprivation across Hong Kong. The resultant maps were compared with a mortality dataset between 2007 and 2014, based on a case-series analysis. The case-series analysis indicated that using a subjective environmental vulnerability index as an approach for neighborhood mapping is able to estimate the community health risk across Hong Kong. In particular, the following types of cause-specific mortality have significant association with the subjective environmental vulnerability index: 1) mortality associated with mental and behavioral disorders, 2) cardiovascular mortality, 3) respiratory mortality, and 4) mortality associated with diseases of the digestive system. In conclusion, the use of a subjective environmental vulnerability index can be implemented within a community health planning program, especially to reduce long-term adverse impacts on population with mental impairment.},

 abstract = {Environmental deprivation significantly influences urban livability. Previous studies applied spatial data to evaluate environmental deprivation across various neighborhoods, and the identified deprived areas can be directly used in urban planning as areas that need to be addressed. However, perceptions of oneself regarding the local urban environment can influence sense of wellbeing, mental health, and social behavior of this individual; and any adverse feelings from the subjective environmental status can further influence perceived environmental deprivation. This perceived environmental deprivation can be different from the estimation of ``objective'' environmental deprivation, and perception itself can vary among subpopulations. Absence of consideration of variation in perceived environmental deprivation can lead to a failure of sustainable planning to support all oppressed people affected by urban development. Therefore, we combined citizens' perceptions with remote-sensed and administrative data to characterize perceived environmental deprivation among subpopulations, based on a questionnaire with ranks of specific environmental issues under a ``city as a whole'' concept. Generally, perceived environmental deprivation among subpopulations was driven by different facts. Based on the spatial comparison, self-identified urban residents and people aged{\textgreater}=30 have faced higher environmental deprivation across the whole city than self-identified rural residents and younger ages. Females, lower income population, and indoor workers have faced with higher environmental deprivation across urban areas than males and higher income population and outdoor workers. These implied that perceived environmental deprivation may be driven by social behaviors of individuals because of social inequality, while planning protocols should be targeted to specific populations to provide comprehensive community support and equity. {\copyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {Sky View Factor (SVF, a dimensionless value between 0 and 1 representing obstructed and unobstructed sky, respectively) has an important influence on urban energy balance, and is a key contributor to the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect experienced by heavily built up regions. Continuous urban SVF maps used in modeling the spatial distribution of UHI can be derived analytically using Lidar data; however, Lidar data are costly to obtain and often lack complete coverage of large cities or metropolitan areas. This study develops and validates a method for estimating continuous urban SVF from globally available Landsat TM data, based on the presence of shadows cast by SVF-reducing urban features. SVF and per-pixel shadow proportion (SP) were first calculated for synthetic grid cities to confirm a logarithmic relationship between the two properties; then Lidar data from four US cities were used to determine an empirical regression relating SP to SVF. Spectral Mixture Analysis was then used to estimate per-pixel SP in a Landsat 5 TM image covering the Greater Vancouver Area, Canada, and the empirical regression was used to calculate SVF from per-pixel SP. The accuracy of the resulting SVF map was validated using independent Lidar-derived SVF data (R2 = 0.78; RMSE = 0.056). {\copyright} 2016 by the authors.},

This data source is extensively used in archaeology; however, various remains of past human activities are not recorded in sufficient detail, or are missing completely. The main purpose of this paper is to present a cost-effective approach providing reliable and accurate 3D documentation of the deserted medieval settlement of Hound Tor, a complex site consisting of preserved stone building walls and field system remains. The proposed procedure integrates ALS data with structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry into a single data source (point cloud). Taking advantage of the benefits of both techniques (reclassified ALS data documents the hinterland, while SfM records the residential area in high detail), an enhanced 3D model has been created surpassing the available ALS data and reflecting the actual state of preserved features. The final outputs will help with the management of the site, its presentation to the general public, and also to enrich understanding of it. As both data sources are currently easily accessible and the proposed procedure has only limited budget requirements, it can be easily adopted and applied extensively (e.g., for virtual preservation of threatened complex sites and areas). {\copyright} 2018 by the authors.},

 abstract = {Lov{\v{e}}t{\'i}n was a medieval village located in the Bohemian-Moravian Upland (Czech Republic). It existed approximately between the 14th and the 16th century and was comprised of up to 20 farmsteads. Arable farming based on a short-fallow cultivation system was its main means of subsistence. The fields of the village consisted of two main field areas (128 and 77 ha) and six smaller field areas (up to 8 ha). Our study focused on finding out how human activities have impacted the soil environment imprinted in its geochemical characteristics. The design was based on a 100-m grid (in some cases, a 50-m grid) covering the entire field system (plu{\v{z}}ina) of the village; soil samples were taken from the B horizon at a depth of 15 cm. The analysis was based on XRF spectrometry, returning near total concentrations of the elements. The statistical and GIS analyses were performed on 338 samples, measuring the following elements: Al, Si, K, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Rb, Sr, Zr, Pb, Th, LE (light elements -- combined concentrations for H to Na). The results of the analyses were processed by PCA after ilr transformation. The PCA indicated 16 principal components, of which three were interpreted as direct products of past human activities. The main elements reflecting human activities were Mn, Sr, Th, K, Zn; P contributed also to the interpretations, although it was detected and measured only in 132 cases. Some of the elements were spatially connected to the village in terms of their concentrations, but the PCA did not reveal a strong connection (Ti, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zr). The spatial distribution of the principal components was varied, indicating a diversity in the spatial distribution of agricultural activities or of their intensity, as well as differences in land use management. Management was most intensive in the vicinity of the village built-up area up to a distance of 300--400 m. The village was probably deserted due to inadequate soil management strategies. {\copyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {In mountainous areas, surface solar radiation (SSR) exhibits high spatiotemporal variation at different slopes and aspects due to its great topographic relief. To get mountain SSR spatial distribution, remote sensing-based methods have been popularly used, which separate SSR into direct solar radiation, diffuse sky radiation, and adjacent terrain radiation. However, the methods are highly depended on the atmospheric and angular information derived from different data sources. To clearly address the uncertainties associated with the estimation, this letter conducted a preliminary comparison study by using different atmospheric transmittance models and digital elevation model (DEM) data to retrieve SSR in the Mt. Gongga region. The comparison results indicated that the uncertainty of the atmospheric constituent data greatly limited the performance of the physical atmospheric transmittance models. The resolution of DEM data also played an important role in SSR determination because of the determination of surface angular information. High-resolution (30-m) DEM data showed better performance than low one (90 m). In addition, the systematic underestimation of SSR estimation with the empirical model was significantly improved by using the averaging method with nearby pixel values. It indicated that the geometric errors of satellite image and DEM data should be considered in the estimation. {\copyright} 2017 IEEE.},

 abstract = {The Urban heat island (UHI) effect is an increasingly serious problem in urban areas. Information on the driving forces of intra-urban temperature variation is crucial for ameliorating the urban thermal environment. Although prior studies have suggested that urban morphology (e.g., landscape pattern, land-use type) can significantly affect land surface temperature (LST), few studies have explored the comprehensive effect of 2D and 3D urban morphology on LST in different urban functional zones (UFZs), especially at a fine scale. Therefore, in this research, we investigated the relationship between 2D/3D urban morphology and summer daytime LST in Wuhan, a representative megacity in Central China, which is known for its extremely hot weather in summer, by adopting high-resolution remote sensing data and geographical information data. The ``urban morphology'' in this study consists of 2D urban morphological parameters, 3D urban morphological parameters, and UFZs. Our results show that: (1) The LST is significantly related to 2D and 3D urban morphological parameters, and the scattered distribution of buildings with high rise can facilitate the mitigation of LST. Although sky view factor (SVF) is an important measure of 3D urban geometry, its influence on LST is complicated and context-dependent. (2) Trees are the most influential factor in reducing LST, and the cooling efficiency mainly depends on their proportions. The fragmented and irregular distribution of grass/shrubs also plays a significant role in alleviating LST. (3) With respect to UFZs, the residential zone is the largest heat source, whereas the highest LST appears in commercial and industrial zones. (4) Results of the multivariate regression and variation partitioning indicate that the relative importance of 2D and 3D urban morphological parameters on LST varies among different UFZs and 2D morphology outperforms 3D morphology in LST modulation. The results are generally consistent in spring, summer and autumn. These findings can provide insights for urban planners and designers on how to mitigate the surface UHI (SUHI) effect via rational landscape design and urban management during summer daytime. {\copyright} 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

LST was downscaled based on its relationship to topographic variables derived from digital elevation data of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), land cover data (MODIS product MCD12Q1), and surface reflectances in the visible red and near-infrared, which both are provided with the MODIS/Terra daily product MOD09GQ at {\~{}} 250 m resolution. The approach was tested for a complex landscape in the Eastern Mediterranean, the Jordan River Region, with LST fields from aggregated Landsat-7 ETM+ and MODIS (MODIS/Terra LST product MOD11A1) data; as reference at the finer scale, we used Landsat-7 derived LST data. For the ideal-case scenario with both degraded and reference values from the same sensor (Landsat-7 ETM+), root mean square errors (RMSE) of downscaled LSTs ranged from 1.02 K to 1.43 K for six different acquisition dates. When compared to the widely-adopted and in parallel applied TsHARP sharpening method, that is based on the relationship between NDVI and LST, downscaling accuracy with RF improved up to 19{\%}. Applying the RF approach to MODIS LST products yielded RMSEs from 1.41 K to 1.92 K, whereas the TsHARP method and also a uniform disaggregation by resampling provided only slightly worse results. For the real MODIS LST product, downscaling with RF was affected by lower thermal contrasts in the image data that hindered an adequate training to reproduce temperature variations at the finer scale of {\~{}} 250 m. In this context, we assume the LST product of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument (as a successor of MODIS onboard the SUOMI NPP platform) to be a better candidate for downscaling, as it provides a spatial resolution of {\~{}} 750 m. One advantage of the RF approach is that predictor datasets can easily be adapted to data availability. In an extended RF approach with all Landsat spectral bands, downscaling results for formerly aggregated Landsat data improved distinctly and now ranged from 0.98 K to 1.33 K. This approach is also promising for the downscaling of real MODIS or VIIRS LST data as it may be combined with already available reflective data fusion models that are able to blend Landsat data and sensor data with a coarse spatial resolution (given spectral bandwidths corresponding to Landsat) to generate temporally dense synthetic Landsat time series. {\copyright} 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

 abstract = {Archeologists have used Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) as a remote sensing technique for creating high resolution and high accuracy elevation models of the earth's surface in forested areas. In the Maya area, LiDAR allows archeologists to conduct full-coverage regional surveys for the first time. Yet due to variation across space in the characteristics of vegetation, topography, and the kinds of archeological features that archeologists seek to locate, the use of LiDAR in the tropics will not meet the same level of success in every case study. Such variation in vegetation, topography, and archeological features also creates opportunities for archeologists to explore methodological adjustments that can maximize the usefulness of LiDAR data for a particular forested area. Using a case study from Northern Yucatan, Mexico, this paper explores a variety of techniques for visually rendering LiDAR data in an attempt to determine which technique works best for identifying low stone residential platforms given the local topography and vegetation. The most successful technique, a color-classified DEM, was then used to locate hundreds of previously undocumented platforms in the area of LiDAR coverage. Conducting a rapid vegetation survey showed that more features can be found in forested areas when there is less vegetation close to the ground. Vegetation surveys permit the calculation of vegetation-specific correction factors to be used in conclusions derived from LiDAR imagery. {\copyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

 abstract = {The successful analysis of LiDAR data for archaeological research requires an evaluation of effects of different vegetation types and the use of adequate visualization techniques for the identification of archaeological features. The Ceibal-Petexbatun Archaeological Project conducted a LiDAR survey of an area of 20 $\times$ 20 km around the Maya site of Ceibal, Guatemala, which comprises diverse vegetation classes, including rainforest, secondary vegetation, agricultural fields, and pastures. We developed a classification of vegetation through object-based image analysis (OBIA), primarily using LiDAR-derived datasets, and evaluated various visualization techniques of LiDAR data. We then compared probable archaeological features identified in the LiDAR data with the archaeological map produced by Harvard University in the 1960s and conducted ground-truthing in sample areas. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the OBIA approach to vegetation classification in archaeological applications, and suggests that the Red Relief Image Map (RRIM) aids the efficient identification of subtle archaeological features. LiDAR functioned reasonably well for the thick rainforest in this high precipitation region, but the densest parts of foliage appear to create patches with no or few ground points, which make the identification of small structures problematic. {\copyright} 2017 by the authors.},

 abstract = {The sky view factor (SVF) is a crucial variable widely used to quantify the characteristics of surface structures and estimate surface radiation budget. Many SVF models based on raster data have been developed but not yet evaluated in a more quantitative and uniform manner. In this paper, four typical SVF models (Dozier-Frew (D-F), Manners, Lindberg-Grimmond (L-G), and Helbig{\_}h) are evaluated using the SVF derived from simulated fisheye images based on the digital surface model (DSM) and digital elevation model data. The SVF calculated by D-F method using DSM data has the best accuracy, with a mean bias error of $-$0.007, root-mean-square error of 0.069, and coefficient of determination (R 2 ) of 0.914. For the SVF value derived from digital elevation model data, L-G method shows good performance, with an mean bias error of 0.013, root-mean-square error of 0.032, and R 2 of 0.897. The pixels near the edges of buildings, within the valley or along ridgelines, have higher SVF deviations. In addition, the slope angle calculated using DSM data has some artificial defects that make the significant impact on the SVF biases due to their calculation method and the discontinuous surface in urban areas. Thus, L-G and Helbig{\_}h methods are more applicable for the DSM data due to the difficulty in defining slope and aspect angles. Moreover, the high accordance of SVFs between Helbig{\_}h and L-G methods implies that the Helbig{\_}h method is an alternative in virtue of its simpler form and lower computation cost than L-G method. {\copyright}2019.

 abstract = {In order to assess glacier runoff to the Upper Columbia River Basin (UCRB) and quantify energy balance effects of tributary-trunk detachment due to recession, we used field observations to develop a distributed melt model of Shackleton Glacier, Canadian Rockies. Field data were derived from meteorological stations, ablation and snowline measurements, and weather observations between 2004 and 2010. Katabatic wind speed and direction were linked to terrain heat advection and irradiance, potentially resulting in significant cross-glacier gradients in melt. A geographic information system-based distributed melt model, using standard energy balance components, was developed for the 2010 melt season. Benchmark model parameterisations were derived for clear, cloudy and overcast days. Novel model parameterisations include terrain irradiance using a sky view factor and an albedo mask, and a katabatic wind 'switch' with valley temperature thresholds. Modelled energy balance components suggest significant sensitivities to terrain irradiance and katabatic wind, in part related to cloudiness. Glacier-wide melt decreased by 10-15{\%} when katabatic wind was turned off, with an interesting spatial pattern. Longwave radiation from valley walls increased local melt up to 30{\%}, but net glacier-wide effects were {\&}lt;6{\%}. Daily glacier melt was 0.1-0.8 millionm3w.e.day-1 and peaked in early August. Net 2010 planar-area melt was 38-50 millionm3w.e., depending on cold storage, whereas slope-corrected-area melt was {\~{}}4{\%} higher. Our results indicate that katabatic wind and terrain are important in calculations of ablation in fragmenting glacier systems and that late-summer glacier contribution to UCRB runoff at Mica Dam is {\~{}}25{\%}. {\copyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Johnson.2016,
 abstract = {English-style agriculture in the northeastern United States spurred widespread deforestation beginning in the 17th century. Heavy plowing within a rocky, glacial till-mantled landscape resulted in soil erosion and deep frosts. For hundreds of years, stones exposed at the surface due to these processes were built into walls that have become an iconic feature of this landscape, and indicative of past human impacts and land use dynamics in areas that are now reforested. We investigate stone walls in five towns in Connecticut, USA, using airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), field measurements, surficial geology maps, and historic agricultural census data. Stone walls are prevalent throughout the study region ($\sim$2113 km over $\sim$569 km2), but spatial density ranges widely from 0 to 12 km/km2. Important controls on the density of stone walls include surficial materials (e.g., $\sim$4.0 km/km2 on glacial till compared to 1.5 km/km2 on floodplain alluvium), and whether land had been ``improved'' for agriculture ($\sim$5.2 km/km2). The length of stone walls derived from analysis of LiDAR data combined with field measurements (average height of 0.76 $\pm$ 0.23 m; width of 0.96 $\pm$ 0.50 m), indicates that an average of $\sim$1.4 $\times$ 106 m3 of stone was moved for constructing walls in the study towns alone. Overall, this study highlights the spatial distribution of 17th-20th century agriculture and Anthropocene landscape change in the northeastern USA, providing important implications for human-environment studies in other deglaciated regions of the United States and landscapes with stone-rich soils on a global scale where historic agriculture occurred. {\copyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {High resolution airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) has become a commonly used resource on a global scale to study landscapes and associated cultural features, especially in areas covered by dense forest. While LiDAR allows for unprecedented views of the terrain beneath the forest canopy, and of landscapes at broad scales generally, few studies have provided an examination of features within theoretical frameworks used to describe landscapes, or have acknowledged LiDAR data as a palimpsest. Any derivative imagery from LiDAR data depicts a moment in time of a contemporary landscape with topographic traces of cultural and physical elements from a range of time periods within and beyond human history. In order to effectively interpret the landscape as represented through LiDAR, it is critical to supplement this data with multiple contextual sources and a more robust theoretical geographic framework. While the concept of landscape as a palimpsest is well known, for the first time in hyper-realistic form we can see and physically interpret that palimpsest, along with the traces of data processing and visualization that we ourselves add to the digital landscape palimpsest in an effort to interpret it. This study provides a critical examination of the LiDAR landscape as a palimpsest, summarizes studies that have used a combination of LiDAR and supplementary resources, and provides observational examples from the northeastern United States, thus providing a practice-based observational and theoretical framework from which other landscapes and associated cultural features can be studied using LiDAR. {\copyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {The present study was focused on analysis of the geometrical and topological features of the lineament network in the Gorce Mountains, Polish Outer Carpathians. The source data was a 1m high-resolution LiDAR digital elevation model (DEM). Network topology was analysed using the NetworkGT toolset for ArcGIS software. The topological analysis represented the first attempt to apply research of this type in the Polish Carpathians. Five lithostratigraphic units occurring in the research area, characteristic of the Krynica Zone of the Magura Nappe, were selected for analysis. Topology was studied for each of the units separately as well as for the whole area. It was found that the units were differentiated in terms of some topological parameters, such as 2D intensity. Moreover, latitudinal trends were observed due to the presence of wide fault zones. The geometry of the network is consistent with the general Carpathian overview. Sets of conjugate strike slip-faults with splaying ends were identified. In the southern part of the area, the strike of the oldest faults was E-W. This shows that on the scale of the observation (hundreds to thousands of metres), the network was a product of general thrusting processes rather than derivative of a local structural plan. The applicability of both topological analyses and high-resolution DEM as supplementary to classical methods in a study of the Outer Carpathians was confirmed with analysis conducted, despite the identification of some limitations, such as GIS-operator-related bias. The scale of the analyses is linked, in a multi-scale approach, to structural network analyses. {\copyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {Fog is an important component of the water cycle in northern coastal regions of Iran. Having accurate tools for mapping the precise spatial distribution of fog is vital for water harvesting within integrated water resources management in this semi-humid region. In this study, environmental variables were considered in prediction mapping of areas with high concentrations of fog in the Vazroud watershed, Iran. Fog probability maps were derived from four artificial intelligence algorithms (Generalized Linear Model, Generalized Additive Model, Generalized Boosted Model, and Generalized Dissimilarity Model). Models accuracy were assessed using Receiver Operating characteristic Curve (ROC). Three social variables were also selected according to their relevance for fog suitability mapping. Finally, Fog-water harvesting Capability Index (FCI) maps were produced by multiplying fog probability by fog suitability maps. The results showed high accuracy in fog probability mapping for the study area, with all models proving capable of identifying areas with high fog concentrations in the south and southeast. For all models, the highest values of importance were obtained for sky view factor and the lowest for slope curvature. Analytic Hierarchy Process results showed the relative importance of social conditioning factors in fog suitability mapping, with the highest weight given to distance to residential area, followed by distance to livestock buildings and distance to road. Based on the fog suitability map, southeast and southern parts of the study area are most suitable for fog water harvesting. The fog spatial distribution maps obtained can increase fog water harvesting efficiency. They also indicate areas for future study with regions where fog is a critical component in the water cycle.},

 abstract = {With the increased availability of high-resolution digital terrain models (HRDTM) generated using airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR), new opportunities for improved mapping of geohazards such as landslides arise. While the visual interpretation of LiDAR, HRDTM hillshades is a widely used approach, the automatic detection of landslides is promising to significantly speed up the compilation of inventories. Previous studies on automatic landslide detection often used a combination of optical imagery and geomorphometric data, and were implemented in commercial software. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential of open source software for automated landslide detection solely based on HRDTM-derived data in a study area in Burgenland, Austria. We implemented a geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) consisting of (1) the calculation of land-surface variables, textural features and shape metrics, (2) the automated optimization of segmentation scale parameters, (3) region-growing segmentation of the landscape, (4) the supervised classification of landslide parts (scarp and body) using support vector machines (SVM), and (5) an assessment of the overall classification performance using a landslide inventory. We used the free and open source data-analysis environment R and its coupled geographic information system (GIS) software for the analysis; our code is included in the Supplementary Materials. The developed approach achieved a good performance (\textgreek{k} = 0.42) in the identification of landslides. {\copyright} 2019 by the authors.},

 abstract = {Airborne laser scanning (ALS) greatly accelerated and expanded traditional archaeological landscape surveys in the forested regions of the ancient Maya. Private and public funding enabled landscape visualizations ranging from site-scale to almost regional investigations. However large-scale, the airborne scanning missions are limited in the area they can cover. This is why in this paper we analyze the potential of a free, globally available lidar dataset for archaeological exploration in a forested environment. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) is a full waveform lidar instrument mounted on the International Space Station. The study area is Chact{\'u}n, one of the largest Maya urban centers in the central lowlands of the Yucatan peninsula. Compared to airborne laser systems, the scanning density of GEDI is low; therefore, we examined whether the density and scanning pattern enable direct observation of buildings from a derived elevation model, and whether the presence of buildings can be assumed from the statistics of the canopy structure. Our research shows that the lack of coverage and low density of GEDI points makes the dataset as yet unsuitable for the intended application of archaeological feature recognition. The presence of buildings in our study area can neither be directly observed nor assumed based on biophysical parameters. {\copyright} 2021 The Author(s)},

 abstract = {The subarctic boreal forest, or taiga, is the largest biome in the world but has received minimal archaeological research because of its remoteness and difficult working conditions. In Southcentral Alaska the most common archaeological sites are surface manifestations of proto-historic semi-subterranean caches once used for food storage and living structures. However, in dense summer vegetation, these small-scale features are difficult to locate without high intensity pedestrian survey. To test the usefulness of LiDAR data for archaeological prospection in the taiga, we compare LiDAR imagery to the known distribution of small-scale semi-subterranean cultural features. The use of LiDAR, when complemented with Sky-View Factor, has proven valuable in identifying relatively small semi-subterranean features though it does not replace on-the-ground investigation. Nevertheless, the application of LiDAR to locate low density and small-scale cultural features is widely applicable across the subarctic in densely vegetated contexts and may assist in significantly expanding our current knowledge of land-use patterns and site distributions in logistically challenging places. {\copyright} Trustees of Boston University 2016.},

The rainfall caused a shallow landslide which was transformed instantly into a debris flow disaster in the Heliu catchment. We integrate remote sensing, rainfall analysis, micro-topography interpretation, lineament of tree fall, field investigation, a UAV survey, and RAMMS simulation to explore the failure mechanism and flow dynamics of this rainfall-induced debris flow. The high resolution shading relief map depicts the landforms of both the old deep-seated landslide and the ancient debris-flow fan. In this study, different numerical scenarios are performed by RAMMS to analyze the possible influence area via adopting the back-analysis approach. In comparison with the post-disaster landform model, the bestfit parameters for Heliu debris flow were also obtained. In addition, verification of dynamic images demonstrates that the maximum flow velocities for the event and deposition height on the debris-flow fan are about 14.3 m/s and 1-5 m, respectively. {\copyright} 2016, Chinese Soil and Water Conservation Society.

 abstract = {Typhoon Megi (2010) and the co-movement of the concurrent northeast monsoon brought massive rainfall to the Suao area of Yilan County, Taiwan, causing clusters of sediment-related landslide disasters on Provincial Highway No. 9. The most notable of these events was the large-scale landslide on the upper slope at 115.9~km near Don-Ao Peak, which dumped 2.1~million cubic meters of sediment into the streambed. Rainfall runoff turned this into a debris flow forming an alluvial fan at the river mouth. This study analyzed the evolution of landscapes in the area through a field investigation, disaster-causing mechanisms, image interpretation, and airborne LiDAR. Our results indicate that the landslide was associated with its location at a lithological junction as well as local geological structures. Interpretation of micro-photography revealed that the topographical changes in landslide areas in the Dakeng Stream catchment are controlled by the headward development of erosion gullies and the concave shape of the slopes. Previous earthquakes and rainfall exceeding that of a 200-year event were the external precipitating factors. {\copyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In this study, the large-scale landslide that occurred in Hongye Village, Taitung County in Eastern Taiwan, on September 15, 2016, was investigated. We combined both the microtopography features from the DEM and canopy openness in the DSM to establish an assess- ment procedure for landslide hotspot extraction. Drone photography and three-dimensional modeling techniques were used to measure the sediment transportation process and conduct postdisaster influence area mapping. The results showed that the landslide area, mean sliding depth, and volume of the landslide in Hongye Village were approximately 4.5 ha, 5.1 m, and 22.8•104 m3, respectively. The runout distance of the initial landslide was 960 m and increased to 1.23 km when the landslide transformed into debris flow in the village. Field validation indicated that the landslide-prone area and subsidence features on the forest canopy could be recognized using a sky-view factor relief and local relief model. Moreover, a complete landslide susceptibility assessment approach suitable for the catchment scale is presented. {\copyright} 2018, Chinese Soil and Water Conservation Society. All right reserved.},

 abstract = {A view factor is an important morphological parameter used in parameterizing in-canyon radiative energy exchange process as well as in characterizing local climate over urban environments. For realistic representation of the in-canyon radiative processes, a complete set of view factors at the horizontal and vertical surfaces of urban facets is required. Various analytical and numerical methods have been suggested to determine the view factors for urban environments, but most of the methods provide only sky-view factor at the ground level of a specific location or assume simplified morphology of complex urban environments. In this study, a numerical method that can determine the sky-view factors (\textgreek{y}ga and \textgreek{y}wa) and wall-view factors (\textgreek{y}gw and \textgreek{y}ww) at the horizontal and vertical surfaces is presented for application to real urban morphology, which are derived from an analytical formulation of the view factor between two blackbody surfaces of arbitrary geometry. The established numerical method is validated against the analytical sky-view factor estimation for ideal street canyon geometries, showing a consolidate confidence in accuracy with errors of less than 0.2~{\%}. Using a three-dimensional building database, the numerical method is also demonstrated to be applicable in determining the sky-view factors at the horizontal (roofs and roads) and vertical (walls) surfaces in real urban environments. The results suggest that the analytically based numerical method can be used for the radiative process parameterization of urban numerical models as well as for the characterization of local urban climate. {\copyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.},

 abstract = {Urban atmospheric environmental issues are commonly associated with the physical processes of urban surfaces. Much progress has been made on the building-resolving microscale atmospheric models, but a realistic representation of the physical processes of urban surfaces on those models is still lacking. This study presents a new microscale urban surface energy (MUSE) model for real urban meteorological and environmental applications that is capable of representing the urban radiative, convective, and conductive energy transfer processes along with their interactions, and that is directly compatible with the Cartesian grid microscale atmospheric models. The physical processes of shadow casting and radiative transfers were validated on an analytical accuracy level. The full capability of the model in simulating the three-dimensional surface heterogeneities in a real urban environment was tested for a hot summer day in August 2016 using the field measurements obtained from the Kongju National University campus, South Korea. The validation against the measurements showed that the model is capable of predicting surface temperatures and energy balance fluxes in a patch scale at the heterogeneous urban surfaces by virtue of the interactive representation of the urban physical processes. The excellent performance and flexible grid design emphasize the potential capabilities of the MUSE model for use in urban meteorological and environmental applications through the building-resolving microscale atmospheric models, such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and large-eddy simulations (LES). {\copyright} 2020 by the authors.

 abstract = {Topography affects the resource distribution and limits physical living and production conditions in mountainous regions. Depicting the specific positive and negative terrains in karst region would support for understanding ecosystem process and land resources managing in ecologically fragile areas. However, positive and negative terrains, specific topographic types in karst region, have been difficult to extract by the automatic machine quantitative method. The novelty of this study is developing a two-level nested (TLN) model to quantify and extract positive and negative terrains features of karst through utilizing visualization indicators, openness and the sky-view factor (SVF), combing an insight of morphological analysis. The algorithms of the two visualization indicators detected the surface morphological changes in 3D sphere and realized self-adaptive of complicated topographic changes. There were three main modules included in the two-level nested model: optimum radius analysis of selected indicators, optimum threshold judgement of positive and negative terrains edges and a morphological postprocessing module. The two-level chained process designed in the second module reached the quantitative potential critical thresholds detection and optimizing expression of positive and negative terrains boundaries, which integrated analyzing the variation trend of openness difference, SVF value and SVF change. Through the TLN framework, the accuracy and stability of positive and negative terrains boundaries extraction by openness and SVF were further strengthened. The TLN model was tested in seven counties where the karst terrain morphologies were quite different. The boundaries extracted by our TLN model were compared with the visual interpretation results, and the accuracy assessment validated that the overlapping areas of test and reference results were more than 90{\%} and the boundaries' distance deviations were less than one grid. Positive terrain was predominant in all study areas and the proportions varied from 75.33 to 85.23{\%}. Different positive and negative terrains percentages and formations indicated different phases in landform and ecosystem evolution process. The largest proportion of cultivated land appeared in the 0--150 m buffer ring where mutations were detected, which implied an increased ecological risk of karst region. Therefore, it is urgent to resolve the increasingly serious ecological and environmental issues while ensure agricultural production and economic development. The positive and negative terrains distribution patterns could provide theoretical reference for a rational land use planning in the future. {\copyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {Hemispherical (fisheye) photography is a well-established approach for estimating the sky view factor (SVF). High-resolution urban models from LiDAR and oblique airborne photogrammetry can provide continuous SVF estimates over a large urban area, but such data are not always available and are difficult to acquire. Street view panoramas have become widely available in urban areas worldwide: Google Street View (GSV) maintains a global network of panoramas excluding China and several other countries; Baidu Street View (BSV) and Tencent Street View (TSV) focus their panorama acquisition efforts within China, and have covered hundreds of cities therein. In this paper, we approach this issue from a big data perspective by presenting and validating a method for automatic estimation of SVF from massive amounts of street view photographs. Comparisons were made with SVF estimates derived from two independent sources: a LiDAR-based Digital Surface Model (DSM) and an oblique airborne photogrammetry-based 3D city model (OAP3D), resulting in a correlation coefficient of 0.863 and 0.987, respectively. The comparisons demonstrated the capacity of the proposed method to provide reliable SVF estimates. Additionally, we present an application of the proposed method with about 12,000 GSV panoramas to characterize the spatial distribution of SVF over Manhattan Island in New York City. Although this is a proof-of-concept study, it has shown the potential of the proposed approach to assist urban climate and urban planning research. However, further development is needed before this approach can be finally delivered to the urban climate and urban planning communities for practical applications. {\copyright} 2017 by the authors.},

 abstract = {Palaeolithic research in the Chiltern Hills (southern England) is important for our understanding of the Pleistocene occupation of Britain, through its record of primary-context assemblages identified by Worthington G. Smith in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The information available from these sites and surface findspots is limited by the context in which the assemblages were retrieved, but can inform attempts to locate further relevant sites within the region. These previous sites are all focused around doline features that may have acted as semi-permanent ponds or lakes that recurrently or occasionally attracted hominins. Therefore, the present study presents results of a desk-based geographical information system (GIS) analysis, using publicly available national geological datasets, aiming to identify and characterise probable subsurface doline features within the karstic landscape of the Chilterns, with a regional focus on Hyde Heath (Buckinghamshire). Rather than relying exclusively on surface findspot associations, we follow the Unified Palaeolithic Landscape Approach framework in relation to artefact release and preservation to refine which features would be most conducive to in situ primary preservation of hominin activity and behaviour. This also has implications for landscape management policy and preservation of archaeological sites in the region. {\copyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {A method of performing city-scale ventilation assessments based on remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) technology is proposed and applied effectively in an assessment of the local ventilation environment before and after the construction of the Yanqi Lake Eco-city in Huairou District, Beijing. The ventilation environment of a city is dependent on its background wind environment and ventilation potential. The background wind environment can be assessed through meteorological statistical analyses or numerical simulations, whereas the ventilation potential can be estimated using the underlying surface dynamic roughness length (RL) and the surrounding sky view factor (SVF). Based on the principle of morphology, the RL of a vegetation area is determined mainly by the vegetation types, vegetation canopy area index and vegetation height, whereas the RL of an urban area is defined mainly by the building area coverage and building height. The SVF can be estimated according to high-resolution digital raster elevation data. Based on the combination of the RL and SVF, the ventilation potential is graded, and the ventilation potential index (VPI) is defined and used to assess quantitatively the ventilation capacity of the city. The present study calculates the RL of the Yanqi Lake Eco-city using Landsat-TM5 satellite data from 26 July 2011, Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) satellite data from 2005 and Beijing basic geographical data at 1:2000 from 2009. Subsequently, the RL and ventilation potential distribution of the Yanqi Lake Eco-city is mapped at a 100m spatial resolution. The ventilation conditions before and after the construction of the Yanqi Lake Eco-city are evaluated using the VPI in combination with the background wind field. According to changes in the ventilation capacity, relevant policy suggestions for urban buildings and design factors for ventilated corridors are postulated. {\copyright} 2016 Royal Meteorological Society.},

 abstract = {Wind corridor blueprints are an essential reference for climate planning that takes into account zones of fresh cold air, air channels as well as heat island alleviation zones. This article addresses the matter of how to plan urban wind corridors more efficiently by proposing a ``ventilation potential coefficient'' (VPC) as well as providing an index for natural cold sources. The study additionally proposes a surface urban heat island (SUHI) index as a means of evaluating the severity of the heat island effect. Based on these three indexes, a new method of categorizing urban climatic zones, called ``Climatopes'', is developed. Using the above methods, data from 2016 meteorological observation stations and Landsat8 satellites, as well as urban planning materials and basic geographical information on a scale of 1:2000 are used to create an Urban Climate Analysis Map (UCAnMap) and formulate a plan for the construction of wind corridors in the urban centre of Ji'nan. The results reveal that the intensity of urban heat islands in Ji'nan is closely related to a lack of natural cold sources, the specific layout of different types of land use as well as poor planning of urban ``function zones''. Moreover, there is a significant correlation between the VPC and other factors such as surface roughness length, building height, the density of building frontal area and floor area ratios. The potential wind corridors could also be determined based on the VPC. Based on an UCAnMap composed of 11 Climatopes and background wind environments, this article ascertains that it would be possible to construct a network of 3 Level One corridors (each over 500~m wide) and 11 Level Two corridors (each over 80-m wide). Additionally, regulatory measures and protective legislation are proposed for the corridors, as well as for the city's overall development. {\copyright} 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.},

The spatial morphological parameters such as building height, building density (BD), building standard deviation, floor area ratio(FAR), frontal area index (FAI), roughness length, sky view factor (SVF) and fractal dimension at the 500 m spatial resolution were calculated, and further the relationships of these morphological parameters and WsR was analyzed. Results showed that due to urbanization, the minimum and maximum average annual wind speed of urban areas are 56{\%} and 160{\%} of the suburban wind speed, and urbanization can reduce the wind speed in urban areas at different times by 3{\%} to 27{\%}. On the urban scale, there are significant spatial correlations between the eight morphological parameters and WsR. Except for the quadratic curve of BD and WsR, the other parameters are significantly linearly related to WsR. FAR, FAI and SVF, the three most significant impact factors can individually explain 51{\%}, 48{\%} and 48{\%} of the change of WsR. {\copyright} 2020},

For the 37 AMSs in central Beijing, the relationships between UHI, Wsr, and qr and six spatial morphological parameters (building height (BH), building density (BD), floor area ratio, sky view factor, frontal area index, and roughness length (RL)) and two land surface parameters (vegetation coverage and impervious cover) in the range of 200$-$3000 m from the station were studied. The scale effect of each parameter on local climate was also studied. The results showed that individually, these parameters account for 46.8--79.6 {\%} of the change in UHI, 25.6--52.8 {\%} of the change in Wsr, and 25.7--29.3 {\%} of the change in qr. The impact of spatial morphological parameters on local climate has surpassed that of land surface parameters. The parameters that make the largest contributions to the annual average UHI, Wsr, and qr are RL, BH, and BD, respectively. The optimal influencing ranges of the spatial morphological parameters on UHI, Wsr, and qr are 800$-$1000 m, 1600$-$2600 m, and 1200$-$1400 m, respectively. {\copyright} 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {The present study evaluates a methodological workflow that could identify dinosaur tracks and trackways more comprehensively at outcrop scale. The approach described here is based both on 3D modelling by photogrammetry at different resolutions, and on suitably processed digital elevation models (DEMs). The ichnosite of Anza, Morocco, was chosen to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed pipeline, because 323 dinosaur and pterosaur tracks discovered there have already been published. One subsector containing 89 tracks, identified in the two companion works that followed a traditional approach, was selected and divided into four subzones. By combining different DEM processes (hill-shade, slope, sky-view factor, and positive openness), almost twice as many tracks (175 vs 89) are now identified in these subzones. However, the improvement is not homogeneous. In the first subzone, the previous works reported 25 tracks vs. 22 with the 3D modelling techniques used here, whereas results for the second and third subzones show considerable improvement with 3D (21 vs 38 tracks and 42 vs 81 tracks, respectively). The enhancement is even more dramatic for the fourth subzone, where 34 new tracks are now identified, whereas with the traditional approach, only one track was previously reported. It is likely that such improvements depend on several factors, i.e. the surface conditions of the rocks (e.g. irregularities, cracking, etc.), and on the preservation state and depth of the tracks. Morphometric measurements of tracks and trackways obtained from 3D models are very similar to those derived from traditional fieldwork methods. The digital approach can be applied rapidly at different resolutions, but the models acquired with the pole-mounted camera provide a good compromise, with a resolution high enough ({\~{}}2 mm/pix) to spot tracks, while respecting computational constraints. Once treated, DEMs greatly facilitate the reproduction of track outlines, drawn according to criteria defined by the operator. {\copyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

A procedure for combining the SVF-enhanced DEM with slope and elevation maps is also presented. Then the maps are used to extract the landslide-prone areas and perform a reactivation analysis of the post-Oso landslide using an analytic hierarchy process (AHP). By using the SVF-enhanced DEM to perform the AHP assessment on multi-period images, we accurately evaluate hazard of the landslide for both pre and post-2014 conditions.

 abstract = {Airborne LiDAR is a widely accepted tool for archaeological prospection. Over the last decade an archaeology-specific data processing workflow has been evolving, ranging from raw data acquisition and processing, point cloud processing and product derivation to archaeological interpretation, dissemination and archiving. Currently, though, there is no agreement on the specific steps or terminology. This workflow is an interpretative knowledge production process that must be documented as such to ensure the intellectual transparency and accountability required for evidence-based archaeological interpretation. However, this is rarely the case, and there are no accepted schemas, let alone standards, to do so. As a result, there is a risk that the data processing steps of the workflow will be accepted as a black box process and its results as ``hard data''. The first step in documenting a scientific process is to define it. Therefore, this paper provides a critical review of existing archaeology-specific workflows for airborne LiDAR-derived topographic data processing, resulting in an 18-step workflow with consistent terminology. Its novelty and significance lies in the fact that the existing comprehensive studies are outdated and the newer ones focus on selected aspects of the workflow. Based on the updated workflow, a good practice example for its documentation is presented. {\copyright} 2021 by the authors. Li-censee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

 abstract = {The study of rock wall permafrost has only started ten years ago. The understanding of the role of permafrost degradation in rock wall instabilities must be firstly based on the knowledge of its spatial distribution. The difficulties in mapping rock wall permafrost result as much from its invisibility as its extreme sensitivity to local settings. Thus its modelling becomes an essential tool. An empirico-statistical model built for the mapping of permafrost probability in the rock walls at an Alpine scale is here applied to the Mont Blanc massif, integrating local input variables with high spatial resolution. The importance of the spatial resolution for modelling rock wall permafrost is highlighted: differences in output temperature for the same model can reach up to 2°C between 4 m and 30 m spatial resolutions. A map of the permafrost in the massif rock walls is proposed. 45 to 79{\%} of the 86 km2 of steep rock faces a 40° would be underlain by permafrost. It would be present from 1900 m a.s.l in north faces and 2600 m in south faces in case of favourable local structural settings. Its presence would be more continuous from 2600 m and 3000 m, respectively, but it would occupy the totality of the rock walls, in any aspect from 3600 m as.l. The interpretation of the permafrost index map requires the understanding of the effects of factors that are not taken into account in the model and that favour its occurrence beyond the topoclimatic control, such as fractures and snow cover. The validation of distributed models of permafrost in rock walls, which is extremely variable in space and hardly accessible, is one of the current challenges. {\copyright} 2015 GFG Editions - Tous droits r{\'e}serv{\'e}s.},

For this reason, a digital terrain model (DTM) of the test-site was processed using the Sky-view Factor algorithm and was analysed with an object-based approach, which implied: (1) multiresolution segmentation; (2) classification (main features considered size, shape and colour). The automatically classified shell craters were thus verified during an in situ survey that determined the accuracy of the method in the order of 84{\%} of the total occurrences.

 abstract = {This paper presents the combined use of UAV-derived Digital Elevation Models, optical and IR imaging and multispectral satellite images to produce a (micro)topographic survey of the proto-historic village of Bostel, in the municipality of Rotzo (province of Vicenza, Italy). It aims to improve our knowledge of the structural organization of the site. Different vegetation indices were calculated from the multiband images to enhance the grass and soil-marks in open field, allowing the identification of buried structures. Close-range images were acquired with a commercial DJI Phantom 2 and a customized unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), equipped with both high-resolution digital and IR cameras. Structure from Motion was used on the acquired data to create digital elevation models (DEM) of sample areas, which were enhanced by using different data visualization techniques. Remote sensing analyses were then combined with fieldwork data, producing a complex environmental model. The houses found during the excavations seem to be embedded in a framework of structures for the sake of space organization, defence and control. Moreover, the presence of a dense network of terraces and buildings, running right up to the south-eastern ridge of the promontory, confirms the existence of an intense human occupation of the entire area. {\copyright} 2019 Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche.

 abstract = {A single-band surface temperature retrieval method is proposed, aiming at achieving a better accuracy by exploiting the integration of aerial thermal images with LiDAR data and ground surveys. LiDAR data allow the generation of a high resolution digital surface model and a detailed modeling of the Sky-View Factor (SVF). Ground surveys of surface temperature and emissivity, instead, are used to estimate the atmospheric parameters involved in the model (through a bounded least square adjustment) and for a ﬁrst assessment of the accuracy of the results. The RMS of the difference between the surface temperatures computed from the model and measured on the check sites ranges between 0.8 °C and 1.0 °C, depending on the algorithm used to calculate the SVF. Results are in general better than the ones obtained without considering SVF and prove the effectiveness of the integration of different data sources. The proposed approach has the advantage of avoiding the modeling of the atmosphere conditions, which is often difﬁcult to achieve with the desired accuracy; on the other hand, it is highly dependent on the accuracy of the data measured on the ground. {\copyright} 2016 by the authors},

 abstract = {Despite the recognized effectiveness of LiDAR in penetrating forest canopies, its capability for archaeological prospection can be strongly limited in areas covered by dense vegetation for the detection of subtle remains scattered over morphologically complex areas. In these cases, an important contribution to improve the identification of topographic variations of archaeological interest is provided by LiDAR-derived models (LDMs) based on relief visualization techniques. In this paper, diverse LDMs were applied to the medieval site of Torre Cisterna to the north of Melfi (Southern Italy), selected for this study because it is located on a hilly area with complex topography and thick vegetation cover. These conditions are common in several places of the Apennines in Southern Italy and prevented investigations during the 20th century. Diverse LDMs were used to obtain maximum information and to compare the performance of both subjective (through visual inspections) and objective (through their automatic classification) methods. To improve the discrimination/extraction capability of archaeological micro-relief, noise filtering was applied to Digital Terrain Model (DTM) before obtaining the LDMs. The automatic procedure allowed us to extract the most significant and typical features of a fortified settlement, such as the city walls and a tower castle. Other small, subtle features attributable to possible buried buildings of a habitation area have been identified by visual inspection of LDMs. Field surveys and in-situ inspections were carried out to verify the archaeological points of interest, microtopographical features, and landforms observed from the DTM-derived models, most of them automatically extracted. As a whole, the investigations allowed (i) the rediscovery of a fortified settlement from the 11th century and (ii) the detection of an unknown urban area abandoned in the Middle Ages. {\copyright} 2018 by the authors.},

@article{Masini.2020,
 abstract = {The Middle Ages have been traditionally considered a crisis period due to the demographic decrease and economic deterioration occurred in Western Europe. Nevertheless, the historical reconsideration has been focused not only on decline and decay, but also on resilience and recovery which characterized the Europe of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. So, today the main open question is as follows: how can we explain the diverse attitude (namely recovery versus decline) and the reasons why some settlements were more (or less) resilient than others? To provide a contribution to this issue, we focused on two medieval villages which are located very close to each other (in the Basilicata Region Southern Italy) and selected because they are characterized by diverse vicissitudes: Irsi abandoned in the fourteenth century and Montepeloso (still ``existing'' and renamed Irsina) where the population of Irsi moved to. To improve our current knowledge on Irsi, we reused and integrated multiscale LiDAR datasets in order to cope with the lack of documentary source. The use of LiDAR data enabled (i) the reconstruction of the potential urban fabric of Irsi, along with its temporal development and the transformation of the surrounding landscape, and (ii) the definition of a hypothesis about the causes of its desertification based on the inter-site analysis between Irsi and Montepeloso. The main results from the LiDAR-based analysis were as follows: (i) the diachronic reconstruction of the building phases of the village and (ii) the identification of a significant indicator obtained as the ratio between the amount of cultivatable land (close to the settlement area) and the population to characterize the resilience behavior in hilly landscape. This approach has been also successfully applied to another similar case study. Outputs from our analyses pointed out that LiDAR data can fruitfully improve medieval archaeological investigations and facilitate knowledge improvement from intra to- inter-site scale analyses and from local up to a landscape perspective. {\copyright} 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

@article{Masini.2020b,
 abstract = {Traditionally the history of remote sensing began during the First World War when aerial photography became a valuable reconnaissance tool. However, moving back more than a thousand years, the real pioneers of remote observation were probably the Nasca, a pre-Hispanic civilization living in southern Peru, between 100BC and 700 AD. They used `earth observation' as a mean of cultural expression drawing the geoglyphs (known as Nasca Lines) only visible from above. These drawings were made on flat desert surface of the Pampa by removing or clearing sand or stones, to create paths for ritual functions to please the gods and create harmonious relationships between man and environment. In this paper, the Nasca geoglyphs in Pampa de Atarco, are object of remote sensing based investigations with the twofold aim to identify and characterize them as well as to analyse and monitor their fragile state of conservation, threatened mainly by vandalism and off road vehicles. The approach herein proposed includes the integration and reuse of diverse remote sensing dataset, from multispectral satellite to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based LSAR data and close range photogrammetry. In particular, a multidate (2002--2013) very high resolution (VHR) optical satellite dataset has been processed in the spatial and temporal domain using textural indicators, including Skewness, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and automatic classification tools which allowed us to enhance the visibility of disturbance features and to automatically extract them. The best results in terms of enhancement and automatic extraction capability of disturbance features have been obtained by Skewness. Moreover, the reuse of UAV L SAR-based correlation map, available free of charge from NASA, provided useful information on the state of disturbance from 2013 to 2015, widening the observation time window of the VHR satellite data set from 2002 to 2013. Finally, the integrated use of satellite VHR data with UAV-based photographs and DTMs, processed using structure from motion (SfM), allowed us to characterize, identify and reconstruct the relative chronological sequence of geoglyphs thus providing new insights and opening new perspectives for archaeological studies. {\copyright} 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

The three-dimensional structures are displayed as their intersections with two-dimensional surfaces that may be defined analytically (e.g., sections) or with grid meshes in the case of irregular surfaces such as the digital terrain models. The process begins with classic techniques of terrain visualisation using hypsometric shading with textures. Then, geometric transformations that are easily conceived and programmed are added, thus representing the three-dimensional structures with their location and orientation. Functions of three variables are used to define the geological structures, and data from digital terrain models are used as one of the variables. This provides a simple source code and results in a short calculation time. Additionally, the process of generating new textures can be performed by a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), thereby making real-time processing very effective and providing the possibility of displaying the simulation of geological structures in motion. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The methodology is based on the two-dimensional hydrodynamic calculation by using shallow water equations both in the conditions prior to the creation of the infrastructure, and in the new conditions after the infrastructure is created. Subsequently, several characteristics, such as water depth and velocity, among others, are compared between the initial and final conditions, and a two-dimensional zoning of the changes observed is obtained. The methodology herein presented is useful to verify the impact that the implantation of different infrastructures around the river currents could produce. In addition, it is also relevant for carrying out a study taking into account different infrastructure options related to river currents, as well as for selecting the most suitable one. By using the methodology presented, changes on the regime of the currents caused by the infrastructures can be deduced, including a qualitative and quantitative zoning of the changes, with a special emphasis on some characteristics, such as depth and velocity.

@article{MatosMachado.2019,
 abstract = {Acting as efficient earth-movers, soldiers can be viewed as significant geomorphological drivers of landscape change when replaced in the recent debates on Anthropocene Geomorphology. `Polemoforms', generated by military activities, correspond with a set of human-made landforms of various sizes and geometries. They are particularly common on the World War One battlefield of Verdun (France) which ranks among the largest battles of attrition along the Western Front. The artillery bombardments and building of defensive positions in that battle significantly altered the landscape, resulting in thousands of shell craters, dugouts, and gun positions that have altered both the meso and microtopography. This paper proposes an innovative methodology to make an exhaustive inventory of these small-scale conflict-induced landforms (excluding linear features such as trenches) using a digital terrain model (DTM) acquired by airborne LiDAR on the whole battlefield. Morphometric analysis was conducted using Kohonen's self-organizing maps (SOMs) and hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) in order to quantify and classify the high number of war landforms. This combined approach allowed for mapping more than one million landforms which can be classified into eight different shapes including shell craters and various soldier-made landforms (i.e. shelters, gun positions, etc.). Detection quality evaluation using field observations revealed the algorithm successfully classified 93{\%} of shell craters and 74{\%} of anthropologically constructed landforms. Finally, the iconographic database and map series produced will help archaeologists and foresters to better manage the historic site of Verdun, today covered by a large forest of {\~{}}10 000 ha. {\copyright} 2019 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd. {\copyright} 2019 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

 abstract = {ALS-derived raster visualization techniques have become common in recent years, opening up new possibilities for subtle landform detection in earth sciences and archaeology, but they have also introduced confusion for users. As a consequence, the choice between these visualization techniques is still mostly supported by empirical knowledge. Some attempts have been made to compare these techniques, but there is still a lack of analytical data. This work proposes a new method, based on gradient modelling and spatial statistics, to analytically assess the efficacy of these visualization techniques. A selected panel of outstanding visualization techniques was assessed first by a classic non-analytical approach, and secondly by the proposed new analytical approach. The comparison of results showed that the latter provided more detailed and objective data, not always consistent with previous empirical knowledge. These data allowed us to characterize with precision the terrain for which each visualization technique performs best. A combination of visualization techniques based on DEM manipulation (Slope and Local Relief Model) appeared to be the best choice for normal terrain morphometry, occasionally supported by illumination techniques such as Sky-View Factor or Negative Openness as a function of terrain characteristics. {\copyright} 2017 by the authors.},

Research is focused on the identification of Neolithic felsite stone tool workshops in the North Mavine region of the Shetland Islands in Northern Scotland. Sample data from known workshops surveyed using differential GPS are used alongside known non-sites to train a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier based on a combination of datasets including Worldview-2 bands, band difference ratios (BDR) and topographical derivatives. Principal components analysis is further used to test and reduce dimensionality caused by redundant datasets. Probability models were generated by LDA using principal components and tested with sites identified through geological field survey. Testing shows the prospective ability of this technique and significance between 0.05 and 0.01, and gain statistics between 0.90 and 0.94, higher than those obtained using maximum likelihood and random forest classifiers. Results suggest that this approach is best suited to relatively homogenous site types, and performs better with correlated data sources. Finally, by combining posterior probability models and least-cost analysis, a survey least-cost efficacy model is generated showing the utility of such approaches to archaeological field survey. {\copyright} 2016 by the authors.},

@article{Megarry.2016b,
 abstract = {Remotely sensed data and imagery have revolutionized the way we understand archaeological sites and landscapes. LiDAR / airborne laser scanning (ALS) has been used to capture the often subtle topographic remnants of previously undiscovered sites even in intensely studied landscapes, and is rapidly becoming a key technology in survey projects with large extents and/or difficult terrain. This paper examines the practical application of this technology to archaeological heritage management, with special attention given to how ALS can support the World Heritage List nomination process and management of WHS archaeological sites and landscapes. It presents a number of examples from published ALS studies alongside case studies from projects undertaken by the authors at Cultural Site Research and Management and the Cultural Site Research and Management Foundation, Baltimore, Maryland, USA. The paper opens with a review of how ALS has been used at established World Heritage Sites, focusing on the Archaeological Ensemble of the Bend in the Boyne, Ireland, and the Angkor Archaeological Site in Cambodia. ALS applications for site prospection and demarcation, and viewshed analysis is explored in this section. Following this, we explore how ALS has been used to support two recent applications: the successfully nominated Monumental Earthworks at Poverty Point, USA and the recently nominated Orheiul Vechi Archaeological Landscape in Moldova. We propose that the detail offered by ALS data greatly strengthens nomination dossiers by emphasizing the outstanding universal value of sites, highlighting significant features and providing greater context to wider landscapes, and is particularly efficacious in delineating site boundaries for legal protection and long-term management. Finally, we conclude with a look at some of the practical considerations involved in the use of ALS, including access and training. {\copyright} 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

@article{MenendezBlanco.2020,
 abstract = {Sixty-six new archaeological sites have been discovered thanks to the combined use of different remote sensing techniques and open access geospatial datasets (mainly aerial photography, satellite imagery, and airborne LiDAR). These sites enhance the footprint of the Roman military presence in the northern fringe of the River Duero basin (Le{\'o}n, Palencia, Burgos and Cantabria provinces, Spain). This paper provides a detailed morphological description of 66 Roman military camps in northwestern Iberia that date to the late Republic or early Imperial eras. We discuss the different spatial datasets and GIS tools used for different geographic contexts of varied terrain and vegetation. Finally, it stresses out the relevance of these novel data to delve into the rationale behind the Roman army movements between the northern Duero valley and the southern foothills of the Cantabrian Mountains. We conclude that methodological approaches stimulated by open-access geospatial datasets and enriched by geoscientific techniques are fundamental to understand the expansion of the Roman state in northwestern Iberia during the 1st c. BC properly. This renewed context set up a challenging scenario to overcome traditional archaeological perspectives still influenced by the cultural-historical paradigm and the pre-eminence of classical written sources. {\copyright} 2020 by the authors.

 abstract = {Through the analysis of new LIDAR data with a mean resolution of 8 measuring points/m2 a survey was conducted of the Campine plateau, an area which is known to harbour many protohistoric sites, including several field complexes (Celtic fields) as revealed through aerial photography and a previous LIDAR survey with a lower resolution. This approach revealed a large number of previously unknown Celtic fields, extending these prehistoric field complexes to several hundreds of hectares. The presence of other known archaeological finds and sites within the confines or surrounding the field systems suggests that the complexes on the Campine plateau were mainly in use during the Hallstatt C-D and Early La T{\`e}ne periods. On a broader regional scale the distribution of Celtic fields in Flanders seems to be related to areas with slightly richer (loamier) sandy soils, i.e. the northern part of the Campine plateau and a region in the Antwerp Campine region. These newly discovered and extended structured complexes foremost provide an important framework for further spatial analysis, research and management of the protohistoric landscape.},

 abstract = {The Sky View Factor (SVF) is a dimension-reduced representation of urban form and one of the major variables in radiation models that estimate outdoor thermal comfort. Common ways of retrieving SVFs in urban environments include capturing fisheye photographs or creating a digital 3D city or elevation model of the environment. Such techniques have previously been limited due to a lack of imagery or lack of full scale detailed models of urban areas. We developed a web based tool that automatically generates synthetic hemispherical fisheye views from Google Earth at arbitrary spatial resolution and calculates the corresponding SVFs through equiangular projection. SVF results were validated using Google Maps Street View and compared to results from other SVF calculation tools. We generated 5-meter resolution SVF maps for two neighborhoods in Phoenix, Arizona to illustrate fine-scale variations of intra-urban horizon limitations due to urban form and vegetation. To demonstrate the utility of our synthetic fisheye approach for heat stress applications, we automated a radiation model to generate outdoor thermal comfort maps for Arizona State University's Tempe campus for a hot summer day using synthetic fisheye photos and on-site meteorological data. Model output was tested against mobile transect measurements of the six-directional radiant flux density. Based on the thermal comfort maps, we implemented a pedestrian routing algorithm that is optimized for distance and thermal comfort preferences. Our synthetic fisheye approach can help planners assess urban design and tree planting strategies to maximize thermal comfort outcomes and can support heat hazard mitigation in urban areas. {\copyright} 2017 by the authors.},

 abstract = {The advent of public open source airborne laser scanning-produced digital elevation models (ALS DEM) has provided new perspectives on glacial geomorphology in the Nordic countries. Seismically-induced micro-topographic paleo-landforms can now be identified and mapped throughout the former Fennoscandian Ice Sheet, allowing spatial safety assessment for nuclear waste disposal. Automated machine learning techniques enable recognition of these fine-scale geomorphological features efficiently and in a consistent way nationwide. The current study focuses on automated recognition of paleo-liquefaction spreads and Pulju moraines in northern Finland. Geomorphometric variables in different cell sizes were first derived from the 2 m ALS DEM by Gabor and principal curvature filtering to emphasize the elevational multi-scale texture of these paleo-seismic landforms. The Gabor textural variables were considered as a baseline method and the principal curvature features, including maximum and minimum curvature, were used because they have previously been proven critical in recognition of concave and convex elongated features. Both sets of raster variables were then turned into histogram-based features and input into a non-linear supervised multilayer perceptron early-stop committee which is a neural network classifier. The leave-one-out cross-validation performance results indicated principal curvature features to be highly successful with 94{\%} accuracy. Principal curvatures provided a clear improvement to Gabor based features which provided significantly lower accuracies between 83 and 85{\%}. The study demonstrates the high success of supervised neural network-based classification of ALS DEM data and derived textural features capturing the multi-scale nature of the micro-topographic liquefaction spreads and Pulju moraines. The approach could be utilized for time-efficient mapping of these paleo-seismic geomorphologies to complete paleo-seismic databases in formerly glaciated regions. {\copyright} 2020},

 abstract = {Rock art studies are facing major technical challenges for extensive documentation. Nowadays, recording is essentially obtained from time-consuming tracing and rubbing, techniques that also require a high level of expertise. Recent advances in 3D modelling of natural objects and computational treatment of the modelled surfaces may provide an alternative, and reduce the current documentation bottleneck. The aim of this study is to examine the extent to which such treatments can be applied. The case study presented here concerns the famous deer stones erected by ancient Mongolian nomad populations. The 3D acquisition workflow is based on structure-from-motion, a versatile photogrammetric technique, well adapted to various field conditions. From the 3D geometry of objects of interest, elevation raster maps are produced by projection on four sides of the stela. These digital elevation models are then tested using algorithms based on differential geometry, sky visibility and local morphology, the general principles of which are briefly exposed. All these approaches may be appropriate with essentially planar surfaces. However, in the case of irregular carved surfaces, such as those of deer stones, the most efficient algorithm appears to be positive openness. In favourable cases, the incisions can be automatically delineated, facilitating the final drawing. Results obtained at the end of the process are comparable to the best drawings available in the literature, and can also include archaeological information about rock surface conditions. The procedure considerably accelerates the workflow in comparison with traditional techniques, reduces the level of expertise required, and provides 3D models, which can easily be shared, or further analysed by morphometric methods, for instance. {\copyright} 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS},

GPS units use stored satellite information to estimate locations, including almanac and ephemeris data reflecting satellite positions at weekly and at {\textless}4-hr temporal scales, respectively. Using the smallest GPS collars (45-51 g) available for mammals, we evaluate how satellite information and environmental conditions affected GPS performance in 27 mobile trials, and field reliability during 56 deployments on Pacific marten (Martes caurina). We conducted trials in Lassen National Forest, California, USA, during March 2011-January 2012. We programmed GPS units to retain or remove satellite data (i.e., continuous or cold-start mode) before attempting a location (fix), thereby mimicking differing fix intervals. In continuous mode, fix success was 2.2$\times$ higher, was not influenced by environmental obstructions, and improved after a location with $\geq$4 satellites (3 -D). In cold-start mode, fix success was negatively correlated with vegetation cover. Location error was lower for 3-D fixes. Censoring cold-start fixes with only 3 satellites (2-D) and 2-D locations prior to the first 3-D fix in continuous mode decreased location error by 91{\%} and 55{\%}, ensuring {\textless}50 m accuracy. The significance of previous fix success and reduced battery expenditure underscores the benefits of ephemeris data and short fix intervals. Only 66{\%} of 56 units functioned upon delivery for field deployment. Once tested and deployed, 28{\%} malfunctioned. This study demonstrates that GPS tests should use the same fix schedules as field deployments, and GPS data quality in dense cover improves with short fix intervals. Miniature GPS units are a promising tool, but the study design should be carefully considered. {\copyright} 2015 The Wildlife Society. {\copyright} The Wildlife Society, 2015.},

 abstract = {Lidar (Light detection and ranging) scanning has revolutionized our ability to locate geographic features on the earth's surface, but there have been few studies that have addressed discovering caves using this technology. Almost all attempts to find caves using lidar imagery have focused on locating sinkholes that lead to underground cave systems. As archaeologists, our work in the Chiquibul Forest Reserve, a heavily forested area in western Belize, focuses on locating potential caves for investigation. Caves are an important part of Maya cultural heritage utilized by the ancient Maya people as ritual spaces. These sites contain large numbers of artifacts, architecture, and human remains, but are being looted at a rapid rate; therefore, our goal is to locate and investigate as many sites as possible during our field seasons. While some caves are entered via sinkholes, most are accessed via vertical cliff faces or are entered by dropping into small shafts. Using lidar-derived data, our goal was to locate and investigate not only sinkholes but other types of cave entrances using point cloud modeling. In this article, we describe our method for locating potential cave openings using local relief models that require only a working knowledge of relief visualization techniques. By using two pedestrian survey techniques, we confirmed a high rate of accuracy in locating cave entrances that varied in both size and morphology. Although 100{\%} pedestrian survey coverage delivered the highest rate accuracy in cave detection, lidar image analyses proved to be expedient for meeting project goals when considering time and resource constraints. {\copyright} 2019 by the authors.

 abstract = {In many applications, such as urban physics simulations or the study of the solar impact effects at different scales, complex 3D city models are required to evaluate physical values. In this article, we propose an efficient system for quickly computing the Sky View Factor (SVF) for a massive number of points inside a large city. To do that, we embed the city into a regular grid, and for each cell we select a subset of the geometry consisting of a square area centred in the cell and including it. Then, we remove the selected geometry from the city model and we project the rest onto a panoramic image, called environment map. Later, when several SVF evaluations are required, we only need to determine the cell that each evaluation point belongs to, and compute the SVF with the cell's geometry plus its corresponding environment map. To test our system, we perform several evaluations inside a cell's area, and compare the results with an accurate ray-tracing-based SVF evaluation. Our results show the feasibility of the method and its advantages when used for a large set of computations. We show that our tool provides a way to handle the complexity of urban scale models, and specifically allows working with geometry details if they are required. {\copyright} 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

 abstract = {Analysing the thermal behaviour of buildings is an important goal for any and all of the tasks involving energy flow simulation in urban environments. However, the number of variables to be considered, along with the difficulty of implementing some of them, make it difficult to address the problem on an urban scale. In this paper we propose a procedural approach that, from a 3D urban model and a set of parameters, simulates the thermal exchanges that take place inside and outside buildings in an urban environment. We also provide a technique to efficiently visualise thermal variations over time of both the interior and exterior of buildings in an urban environment. We believe this technique will be helpful for performing a rapid analysis when building parameters, such as materials, dimensions, shape or number of floors, are being changed. {\copyright} 2019, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

@article{Mutani.2020,
 abstract = {The urban climate and outdoor air quality of cities that have a positive thermal balance depending on the thermal consumptions of buildings cause an increase of the urban heat island and global warming effects. The aim of this work has been to develop an energy balance using the energy consumption data of the district heating network. The here presented engineering energy model is at a neighborhood scale, and the energy-use results have been obtained from a heat balance of residential buildings, by means of a quasi-steady state method, on a monthly basis. The modeling approach also considers the characteristics of the urban context that may have a significant effect on its energy performance. The model includes a number of urban variables, such as solar exposition and thermal radiation lost to the sky of the built environment. This methodology was applied to thirty-three 1~km $\times$ 1~km meshes in the city of Turin, using the monthly energy consumption data of three consecutive heating seasons. The results showed that the model is accurate for old built areas; the average error is 10{\%} for buildings constructed before 1970, while the error reaches 20{\%} for newer buildings. The importance and originality of this study are related to the fact that the energy balance is applied at neighborhood scale and urban parameters are introduced with the support of a GIS tool. The resulting engineering models can be applied as a decision support tool for citizens, public administrations, and policy makers to evaluate the distribution of energy consumptions and the relative GHG emissions to promote a more sustainable urban environment. Future researches will be carried out with the aim of introducing other urban variables into the model, such as the canyon effect and the presence of vegetation. {\copyright} 2020, The Author(s).},

 abstract = {Long-range (LoRa) wireless communication technology has been widely used in many Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications in industry and academia. Radio wave propagation characteristics in forested areas are important to ensure communication quality in forest IoT applications. In this study, 920 MHz band propagation characteristics in forested areas and tree canopy openness were investigated in the Takakuma experimental forest in Kagoshima, Japan. The aim was to evaluate the performance of the LoRa 920 MHz band with spreading factor (SF12) in a forested hilly area. The received signal strength indicator (RSSI) was measured as a function of the distance between the transmitter antenna and ground station (GS). To illustrate the effect of canopy openness on radio wave propagation, sky view factor (SVF) and a forest canopy height model were considered at each location of a successfully received RSSI. A positive correlation was found between the RSSI and SVF. It was found that between the GS and transmitter antenna, if the canopy height is above 23 m, the signal diffracted and RSSI fell to $-$120 to $-$127 dBm, so the presence of the obstacle height should be considered. Further research is needed to clarify the detailed tree density between the transmitter and ground station to propose an optimal propagation model for a forested envi-ronment. {\copyright} 2021 by the authors.

 abstract = {This study aims to determine the dynamics and controls of Surface Urban Heat Sinks (SUHS) and Surface Urban Heat Islands (SUHI) in desert cities, using Dubai as a case study. A Local Climate Zone (LCZ) schema was developed to subdivide the city into different zones based on similarities in land cover and urban geometry. Proximity to the Gulf Coast was also determined for each LCZ. The LCZs were then used to sample seasonal and daily imagery from the MODIS thermal sensor to determine Land Surface Temperature (LST) variations relative to desert sand. Canonical correlation techniques were then applied to determine which factors explained the variability between urban and desert LST. Our results indicate that the daytime SUHS effect is greatest during the summer months (typically $\sim$3.0~°C) with the strongest cooling effects in open high-rise zones of the city. In contrast, the night-time SUHI effect is greatest during the winter months (typically $\sim$3.5~°C) with the strongest warming effects in compact mid-rise zones of the city. Proximity to the Arabian Gulf had the largest influence on both SUHS and SUHI phenomena, promoting daytime cooling in the summer months and night-time warming in the winter months. However, other parameters associated with the urban environment such as building height had an influence on daytime cooling, with larger buildings promoting shade and variations in airflow. Likewise, other parameters such as sky view factor contributed to night-time warming, with higher temperatures associated with limited views of the sky. {\copyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {The thermal comfort conditions in a complex urban area is influenced by the surrounding structures and obstacles which modify the incoming radiation fluxes. A measure of this modification is the sky view factor (SVF), which could be estimated in each point of a selected area if a high resolution digital elevation model (DEM), or other urban morphological data including the manmade infrastructure, are available. The goal of this study is to model the continuous SVF for a complex building environment in the campus of National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, based on a high resolution DEM (0.09 m). For this purpose, we applied the structure-from-motion (SfM) technique, which takes advantage of the interpretation of ultra-high resolution colour images acquired by remotely piloted airborne systems, also known as drones or unmanned aerial vehicles. A quantitative analysis, by applying statistical metrics, yields perfect agreement between modelled and observed SVF values, over the examined area. The proposed methodology could be applied for human-biometeorology research in micro scale complex urban environments. {\copyright} 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

 abstract = {Archaeological topography identification from high-resolution DEMs (Digital Elevation Models) is a current method that is used with high success in archaeological prospecting of wide areas. I present a methodology through which burial mounds (tumuli) from LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) DEMS can be identified. This methodology uses geomorphometric and statistical methods to identify with high accuracy burial mound candidates. Peaks, defined as local elevation maxima are found as a first step. In the second step, local convexity watershed segments and their seeds are compared with positions of local peaks and the peaks that correspond or have in vicinity local convexity segments seeds are selected. The local convexity segments that correspond to these selected peaks are further fed to a Random Forest algorithm together with shape descriptors and descriptive statistics of geomorphometric variables in order to build a model for the classification. Multiple approaches to tune and select the proper training dataset, settings, and variables were tested. The validation of the model was performed on the full dataset where the training was performed and on an external dataset in order to test the usability of the method for other areas in a similar geomorphological and archaeological setting. The validation was performed against manually mapped, and field checked burial mounds from two neighbor study areas of 100 km2 each. The results show that by training the Random Forest on a dataset composed of between 75{\%} and 100{\%} of the segments corresponding to burial mounds and ten times more non-burial mounds segments selected using Latin hypercube sampling, 93{\%} of the burial mound segments from the external dataset are identified. There are 42 false positive cases that need to be checked, and there are two burial mound segments missed. The method shows great promise to be used for burial mound detection on wider areas by delineating a certain number of tumuli mounds for model training.},

 abstract = {Targets hidden in shadow areas are very difficult to detect from hyperspectral images. One way to mitigate this problem is to detect the shadow areas using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors, and to correct for the hyperspectral data in these regions. For this purpose, this paper makes a detailed analysis of real data in shadow regions and compares it the data from open areas where there is no shadow present. Purpose: In this study, the radiance and reflectance values of the shadow regions in hyperspectral data, and their relation to the sky-view factors in a physical model are investigated. With this work, our goal is to understand the physical phenomenon in hyperspectral images that occurs in shadow areas. Theory and Methods: First, shadow regions are found using LiDAR data and their radiance and reflectance values are plotted. Then, sky-view factors are obtained from LiDAR data. Third, using the Modtran software, sky radiance and sun irradiance values are obtained and the radiance values in the shadow region are examined. Lastly, the parameters obtained from the Modtran software as well as the data collected from shadow areas are used in the physical radiance model; and the reflectance values in shadowy areas are analyzed. Results: Path radiance, sky radiance and radiance from adjacent objects were analyzed from three datasets with shadow locations and from open areas where there is no shadow. The physical radiance model as well as the analysis of the real data confirmed that the photons reflected from the objects surronding the shadow region are more dominant than the sky-view factors. Conclusion: Upon investigating the reflectance and radiance values in comparison to the physical radiance model, it was found that the sky-view factors are not as dominant as the photons reflected from the objects surronding the shadow region. {\copyright} 2018 Gazi Universitesi Muhendislik-Mimarlik.

 abstract = {Agricultural production and the palatial redistribution of staples have played a key role in the debate concerning the emergence of social complexity in Minoan Crete. However, much of the focus has fallen on major settlements where such products were consumed, rather than on the landscape where agricultural surplus was produced. While there is no shortage of landscape surveys on Crete, their emphasis has typically been on the distribution of rural settlements instead of on identifying landscape structures and arrangements-such as terraces, enclosures, and field systems-that might provide data about a territory's economic focus. A key aim of the new survey at Palaikastro has been to address this bias. By combining extensive archaeological survey with differential GPS (DGPS) measurements, high-resolution aerial photography, and microrelief generation and analysis, the project has identified hundreds of structures, forming an almost continuous fossilized landscape and providing important clues on landscape management practices. The results highlight the importance of pastoral practices, to which a large part of the landscape was dedicated. Agricultural arrangements were also documented in the form of terraced areas adapted for dryland agriculture and reflecting concerns for soil retention. We argue that a highly structured landscape, indicative of pressures in land use, was established during the Middle and Late Minoan periods across Palaikastro's territory. {\copyright} 2018 Archaeological Institute of America.},

@article{Orengo.2018b,
 abstract = {Morphological analysis of landforms has traditionally relied on the interpretation of imagery. Although imagery provides a natural view of an area of interest (AOI) images are largely hindered by the environmental conditions at the time of image acquisition, the quality of the image and, mainly, the lack of topographical information, which is an essential factor for a correct understanding of the AOI's geomorphology. More recently digital surface models (DSMs) have been incorporated into the analytical toolbox of geomorphologists. These are usually high-resolution models derived from digital photogrammetric processes or LiDAR data. However, these are restricted to relatively small areas and are expensive or complex to acquire, which limits widespread implementation. In this paper, we present the multi-scale relief model (MSRM), which is a new algorithm for the visual interpretation of landforms using DSMs. The significance of this new method lies in its capacity to extract landform morphology from both high- and low-resolution DSMs independently of the shape or scale of the landform under study. This method thus provides important advantages compared to previous approaches as it: (1) allows the use of worldwide medium resolution models, such as SRTM, ASTER GDEM, ALOS, and TanDEM-X; (2) offers an alternative to traditional photograph interpretation that does not rely on the quality of the imagery employed nor on the environmental conditions and time of its acquisition; and (3) can be easily implemented for large areas using traditional GIS/RS software. The algorithm is tested in the Sutlej-Yamuna interfluve, which is a very large low-relief alluvial plain in northwest India where 10 000 km of palaeoriver channels have been mapped using MSRM. The code, written in Google Earth Engine's implementation of JavaScript, is provided as Supporting Information for its use in any other AOI without particular technical knowledge or access to topographical data. {\copyright} 2017 The Authors.

 abstract = {Context: Distance to seed source is often used to estimate seed dispersal---a process needed for post-fire tree recovery. However, distance, especially in mountainous terrain, does not capture pattern or scale-dependent effects controlling seed supply and delivery. Measuring seed source pattern (area and arrangement) could provide insights on how these spatial dynamics shape recovery. Objectives: We tested metrics and investigated how seed source pattern, tree regeneration traits, scale, and terrain interact to shape post-fire tree recovery. Our research questions were: Does seed source pattern outperform distance when modeling tree species presence and regeneration density? If yes, does seed source pattern have scale-dependent or terrain-dependent effects on regeneration density? Methods: We measured seed source pattern at nested spatial extents around 71 plots and related measurements to local post-fire tree recovery. We used generalized linear models to test metrics and visualize scale-dependent and terrain-dependent effects on regeneration density. Results: Distance sufficiently modeled presence, but seed source pattern outperformed distance when modeling regeneration density. Relevant spatial extents and relationships were species-dependent. For wind-dispersed species, regeneration was associated with more seed source area and more complex arrangements, but terrain mediated these relationships. For serotinous and resprouting species, regeneration was associated with less seed source area and less complex arrangements, which are consistent with high-severity burn sites that promote recovery. Conclusions: Seed source pattern supports spatial resilience and interacts with scale and terrain to shape regeneration density. Accounting for these spatial dynamics could help steward forests facing changing fire regimes. {\copyright} 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

Multiple users can alter the physical model by hand during scanning, thereby providing input for simulation of geophysical processes in this setting. The authors have developed innovative techniques and software that couple this hardware with open source GRASS GIS, making the system instantly applicable to a wide range of modeling and design problems. Since no other literature on this topic is available, this Book fills a gap for this new technology that continues to grow. Tangible Modeling with Open Source GIS will appeal to advanced-level students studying geospatial science, computer science and earth science such as landscape architecture and natural resources. It will also benefit researchers and professionals working in geospatial modeling applications, computer graphics, hazard risk management, hydrology, solar energy, coastal and fluvial flooding, fire spread, landscape, park design and computer games. {\copyright} The Author(s) 2015.},

 abstract = {For the past decade, archaeologists have been using LiDAR or Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS)-based methods to uncover trace signatures of human civilization in the landscape. A new technique called bonemapping involves processing the ALS data to create a map-like representation of the landscape, which aids in the detection and interpretation of traces of human settlement. The technique is a combination of two methods-the Simple Morphological Filter (SMRF) for ALS processing and the Perceptually Shaded Slope Map (PSSM) for ALS representation-and is used to represent subtle changes in the terrain that are often indicative of previous human settlement. The SMRF algorithm adds value by retaining more {\textquotedbl}feature{\textquotedbl} cells than comparable terrain-finding algorithms, and is easy to tune through the use of two intuitive parameters-a slope threshold and a window size. The PSSM visualization is then used to apply a vertical exaggeration-based slope shading, which has proven useful as an aid to rapid feature detection, identification, and interpretation. The findings of two years of field use of bonemapping by archaeologists at El Pilar demonstrate the ways in which the bonemap offers a value-added perspective to archaeology under the canopy. {\copyright} 2015 Cartography and Geographic Information Society.},

@article{Pinheiro.2018,
 abstract = {Users of soil survey products are mostly interested in understanding how soil properties vary in space and time. The aim of digital soil mapping (DSM) is to represent the spatial variability of soil properties quantitatively to support decision-making. The goal of this study is to evaluate DSM techniques (Regression Trees - RT and Multiple Linear Regressions - MLR) and the ability of these tools to predict mineral fraction content under a wide variability of landscapes. The study site was the entire Guapi-Macacu watershed (1,250.78 km2) in the state of Rio de Janeiro in the Southeast region of Brazil. Terrain attributes and remote sensing data (with 30 m of spatial resolution) were used to represent landscape co-variables selected as an input in predictive models in order to develop the explanatory variables. The selection of sampling sites was based on the Latin Hypercube algorithm. A representative set of one hundred points with feasible field access was chosen. Different input databases were tested for prediction of mineral fraction content (harmonized and original data). The Spline algorithm was used to harmonize data according to the GlobalSoil.Net consortium standards. The results showed better performance from the RT models, using input from an average of six covariates; the simplest MLR model used twice as many input variables, creating more complex models without gaining precision. Furthermore, better R2 values were obtained using RT models, irrespective of harmonization of soil data. The harmonized dataset from the 0.00-0.05 and 0.05-0.15 m layers, in general, presented better results for the clay and silt, with R2 values of 0.52 (0.00-0.05 m) and 0.69 (0.05-0.15 m), respectively. Prediction of sand content showed better results when the original depth data was used as an input, although all regression tree models had R2 values greater than 0.52. The RT models provided a better statistical index than MLR for all predicted properties; however, the variance between models suggests similarity of performance. Regarding harmonization of soil data, both input databases (harmonized or not) can be used to predict soil properties, since the variance of model performance was low and generalization of the soil maps showed similar trends. The products obtained from the digital soil mapping approach make it possible to integrate the factor of uncertainties, providing easier interpretation for soil management and land use decisions. {\copyright} 2018, Revista Brasileira de Ciencia do Solo.

@article{Popovic.2020,
 abstract = {Many interpretations of the ancient cadastre of the Roman colonies of Pola and Parentium on the Istrian pen-insula in Croatia have been offered recently on the basis of satellite imagery and the Croatian topographic map. This grid, spreading continuously over an area of roughly 1200 km2, was identified through numerous structures which correspond to the ancient Roman metric system, but they were never a part of further re-search. This approach enabled identification of structures that were most often visible in the contemporary cadastre, like modern roads or field boundaries, but gaps were left in areas where the modern cadastre did not reflect the ancient one. Until the commission of airborne laser scanning (ALS or LiDAR), from which our research began, one of these gaps was on the northern side of the Lim bay, in the Municipality of Vrsar. Inter-pretation of ALS data resulted in detecting different, multi-temporal spatial organisations of the landscape, among which were numerous, previously unidentified, remains of the Roman limites. The results of this inter-pretation guided the field inspection. Different surface manifestations of individual remains were categorized, and it was defined which are the original Roman structures. The results of this structural survey subsequently guided the archaeological excavations. Only with the combination of these procedures it was possible to un-derstand the original construction of the limites.},

 abstract = {The vague urban-rural dichotomy severely restricts effective comparisons and communications among urban heat island studies. A local climate zone (LCZ) scheme has therefore been developed to classify urban and natural landscapes in a standardized and universal manner. Despite LCZ mapping efforts in worldwide cities, this study attempts to propose an enhanced geographic information system-based workflow to enable the hierarchical classification of LCZs with fewer indicators but higher accuracies while considering supplementary classes and subclasses. Specifically, five morphological and coverage indicators that were easily obtained and well differentiated among LCZs were derived from a city street map and satellite images, and 25 LCZs (including 16 standard, 3 supplementary, and 6 sub-classified zones) were determined at a block-level according to the indicator hierarchy and criteria. The method was performed over Beijing, China, and evaluations by field surveys and google earth images showed a high accuracy with little noise and sharp boundaries, outperforming the widely-used remote sensing-based method of the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools, particularly in terms of building height and heavy industry. Results also demonstrate that the Beijing core was dominated by open (including extremely open) mid-rise buildings (28.7{\%}) and open low-rise buildings (12.8{\%}), forming an inner-low-middle-high-outer-low annular building-height pattern. Significant land surface temperature differences were detected among the LCZs, where the low-rise and compact LCZs had higher temperatures than the mid-/high-rise and open LCZs during daytime, and subclasses LCZ XB/C/D (LCZ XE/F) generated lower (higher) temperatures than their parent classes in May. This method was proposed to augment the LCZ mapping system and further support applications (e.g., urban planning/management and climate/weather modeling) in high-density cities similar to Beijing. {\copyright} 2019, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

 abstract = {Airborne and spaceborne remote sensing in archaeology generates at least two important issues for discussion: technology and visualization. Technology seems to open new cognitive perspectives for archaeology and keeps researchers increasingly fascinated in its capabilities (archaeological science being a case in point). Acquired data, especially via remote sensing methods, can be studied after processing and visualizing. The paper raises several issues related to the new cognitive situation of archaeologists facing the development of new technologies within remote sensing methods. These issues are discussed from ontological, epistemological, and discursive perspectives, supporting an exploration of the role of technology and visualization. The ontological perspective places the visualization of remote sensing data in the context of understanding Virtual Reality and Jean Baudrillard's simulacra. The epistemological perspective generates questions related to visualization as mimesis, the issue of cultural neutrality, and the use of sophisticated classifications and analytical techniques. The level of discursiveness of visualization includes categories such as persuasion, standardization, and aesthetics. This discussion is framed in relation to Martin Heidegger's understanding of technology and a dichotomy of naturalism versus antinaturalism. {\copyright} 2020 by the authors.},

However, the investigation of other battlefield locations around this stronghold, such as Malvecino Hill, have remained in the background. As the site where the Christian army built a temporary castle, Malvecino played a decisive role during the siege and conquest of Alcal{\'a} la Vieja in 1118 and is a strong candidate for archaeological study. Some early archaeological prospections carried out at Malvecino in the 1970s corroborated the existence of medieval remains. Scholars have debated whether those remains derive from the fortress built by the Christians or to an earlier settlement. Unfortunately, those artefacts and features disappeared and are not available for additional investigation. Given the lack of archeological context, our investigation included the process of locating potential archaeological features in Malvecino Hill using both aerial photography and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) datasets. This article highlights the value of LiDAR prospection as a preliminary step to fieldwork and describes two early medieval structures on Malvecino Hill that were newly revealed by our LiDAR visualization. {\copyright} 2020 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Rehman.2015,
 abstract = {A novel method for computing sky view factor for isotropic diffuse radiations on tilted collectors located in obstacle free and urban sites has been introduced in this paper. The proposed method involves disintegrating the hemispherical sky vault around collector into small portions (sky elements). Collector is a flat receiving surface, positioned at a particular tilt angle and facing a specific azimuthal orientation. The three-dimensional celestial vault is transformed into a two-dimensional plane. This plane is converted into a computer graphic raster image for computing. Each pixel of raster image represents a sky element. Color (gray shade) of every pixel describes specific weight which depends upon sky element's solid angle and incidence angle with respect to collector. Sky view factor is evaluated by taking ratio of the sum of color codes of all the pixels for tilted collector to that of horizontal collector. Sky view factors at different tilt angles for obstacle free sites are evaluated and results are found in good agreement with Liu Jordan method. To evaluate sky view factor for urban sites having obstacles (e.g., buildings, trees, etc.) that may cause sky blocking, the obstacles are taken into account by projecting them onto the celestial vault. Their projections are transformed onto a two dimensional plane and then onto the raster image. For enhancing the applicability of the proposed method, so as to analyze sites with complex sky blocking obstacles, the approach is developed such that it can be computer programmed easily. Small portions of sky can be located and analyzed in a program using a specially developed coordinate system recognized by various programing languages. The program results in grey scaled raster images presenting radiances received by the collector, coming from different portions of the sky. Comparison of sky view factors obtained from the proposed method with existing methods published in literature is also presented. Results show that the proposed methodology is in good agreement with Liu Jordan method and provides more logical results as compared to results published in literature for urban sites with obstacles. The deviations between results are quantified and discussed. {\copyright} 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.},

The UAV survey resulted in a highly detailed and accurate 3D model of the terrain, allowing a thorough topographic analysis of the complex archaeological landscape. Application of algorithms to produce an enhanced visualization of the topographic variability led to a sequence of derivatives each highlighting the topography in a different way.

@article{Risbl.2020,
 abstract = {This paper gives a presentation of how airborne laser scanning (ALS) has been adopted in archaeology in the North over the period 2005-2019. Almost two decades have passed since ALS first emerged as a potential tool to add to the archaeologist's toolbox. Soon after, it attracted the attention of researchers within archaeological communities engaged with remote sensing in the Fenno-Scandinavian region. The first archaeological ALS projects gave immediate good results and led to further use, research, and development through new projects that followed various tracks. The bulk of the research and development focused on studying how well-suited ALS is for identifying, mapping, and documenting archaeological features in outfield land, mainly in forested areas. The poor situation in terms of lack of information on archaeological records in outfield areas has been challenging for research and especially for cultural heritage management for a long period of time. Consequently, an obvious direction was to study how ALS-based mapping of cultural features in forests could help to improve the survey situation. This led to various statistical analyses and studies covering research questions related to for instance effects on detection success of laser pulse density, and the size and shape of the targeted features. Substantial research has also been devoted to the development and assessment of semi-automatic detection of archaeological features based on the use of algorithms. This has been studied as an alternative approach to human desk-based visual analyses and interpretations of ALS data. This approach has considerable potential for detecting sites over large regions such as the vast roadless and unbuilt wilderness regions of northern Fennoscandia, and has proven highly successful. In addition, the current review presents how ALS has been employed for monitoring purposes and for landscape studies, including how it can influence landscape understanding. Finally, the most recent advance within ALS research and development has been discussed: testing of the use of drones for data acquisition. In conclusion, aspects related to the utilization of ALS in archaeological research and cultural heritage management are summarized and discussed, together with thoughts about future perspectives. {\copyright} 2020 by the author.},

In order to record the topography of this area, the first ever scientific airborne LiDAR data acquisition in Lebanon was conducted in autumn 2018. This work describes not only the acquisition and processing of the LiDAR data, but also the attempt to derive possible archaeological sites from the generated elevation model based on methods for spatial analysis. Using an {\textquotedbl}inverted mound{\textquotedbl}(iMound) algorithm, areas of possible settlement structures could be identified, which were classified regarding their probability of a possible ancient site using a deductive predictive model. A preliminary validation of some of the detected favoured areas using high-resolution aerial images has shown that the methods applied can provide hints to previously undiscovered sites. It was possible to identify probable ancient wall remains at several detected locations. In addition, least-cost path analyses were performed to reconstruct possible trade and transport routes from the Lebanon Mountains to the Mediterranean coast. The combination of the results of the iMound detection and classification as well as the calculated path system could point to the strategic location of the modern village of Kfar Hazir as a kind of traffic junction. Moreover, reconstructed main transport routes provide indications of heavily frequented roads and may form the basis for further investigations. To validate the results, upcoming field surveys will be realized on site. {\copyright} 2020 Jakob Rom et al., published by De Gruyter.},

 abstract = {This paper explores the opportunities that arise where forest ecosystem management and cultural heritage monuments protection converge. The case study area for our analysis was the landscape surrounding the Moigrad-Porolissum Archaeological site. We emphasize that an Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS or LiDAR-Light Detection and Ranging) approach to both forest management and cultural heritage conservation is an outstanding tool, assisting policy-makers and conservationists in decision making for integrated planning and management of the environment. LiDAR-derived surface models enabled a synoptic, never-seen-before view of the ancient Roman frontiers defensive systems while also revealing the present forest road network. The thorough and accurate road inventory data are very useful for updating and modifying forest base maps and registries and also for identifying the priority sectors for archaeological discharge. The ability to identify and determine optimal routes for forest management and to locate previously unmapped ancient archaeological remains aids in reducing costs and creating operational efficiencies as well as in complying with the legislation and avoiding infringements. The potential of LiDAR to demonstrate the long-term and comprehensive human impact on wooded areas is discussed. We identified a significant historical landscape change, consisting of a deforestation period, spanning over more than 160 years, during the Roman Period in Dacia (106-271 AD). The transdisciplinary analysis of the LiDAR data provides the base for combining knowledge from archaeology, forestry and environmental history in order to achieve a thorough analysis of the landscape changes and history. In the ``nature versus culture'' dichotomy, the landscape, outfield areas and forests are primarily perceived as nature, while in reality they are often heavily marked by human impact. LiDAR offers an efficient method for broadening our knowledge regarding the character and extent of human interaction with landscapes -- forested or otherwise. {\copyright} 2017, Editura Silvica.

 abstract = {This paper presents the method used to efficiently identify and map previously unknown subsurface remains in a steep, forested, and mostly unexplored area, within the archaeological site of Porolissum, Romania. The remains are part of the defensive system of the ancient Roman Empire frontiers (Roman limes). The complementary use of high-resolution airborne laser scanning derived digital terrain model and visualization techniques enabled the detection of 79 new, subsurface archaeological structures, most of which were confirmed by ground inspection to be key elements of the limes. The best performing methods, achieving detection of the maximum visible extent for over 75{\%} of all features were in descending order: principal component analysis, simple local-relief model, sky-view factor, and positive openness. Analytical hill-shading, slope, negative openness, and hill-shading had a larger proportion of partial detections. The position of these ancient remains supports the hypothesis that this area was extensively deforested, for strategic purposes, during the Roman period. Employing one of the latest remote sensing techniques, we have identified the location of previously unknown, buried ancient structures of the Roman limes in Dacia Province, an essential step for compiling a database necessary for enlisting this Roman limes sector on the World Heritage List. {\copyright} 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

 abstract = {Several methods currently exist to efficiently correct topographic effects on the radiance measured by satellites. Most of those methods use topographic information and satellite data at the same spatial resolution. In this study, the 30 m spatial resolution data of the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) are used to account for those topographic effects when retrieving land surface reflectance from satellite data at lower spatial resolution (e.g., 1 km). The methodology integrates the effects of sub-pixel topography on the estimation of the total irradiance received at the surface considering direct, diffuse and terrain irradiance. The corrected total irradiance is then used to compute the topographically corrected surface reflectance. The proposed method has been developed to be applied on various kilometric pixel size satellite data. In this study, it was tested and validated with synthetic Landsat data aggregated at 1 km. The results obtained after a sub-pixel topographic correction are compared with the ones obtained after a pixel level topographic correction and show that in rough terrain, the sub-pixel topography correction method provides better results even if it tends to slightly overestimate the retrieved land surface reflectance in some cases. {\copyright} 2014 by the authors.},

We test the suitability and practicability of UAV surveying in the tropical lowlands of Brazil and techniques for visualizing the resulting digital elevation models, specifically the Red Relief Image Map (RRIM). We present the results of UAV surveys conducted at four diverse archaeological earthwork sites situated in interfluvial southwestern Amazonia, in the state of Acre. The elevation models produced from UAV derived point clouds display clear patterns in the site layouts and reveal subtle intra-site earthwork features that are not easily discernible on the ground. Our study demonstrates that UAVs are cost efficient and give highly detailed results for topographic mapping and visualization of archaeological features when vegetation cover is sufficiently low and sparse. The rapid data capture and lack of spatial sampling bias of the UAV data collection is a significant advantage compared to conventional mapping methods. Furthermore, UAV surveying and UAV derived data processing do not require expensive technologies or specialized user expertise, since open-source software and easy-to-use toolkits are readily available. {\copyright} 2019 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

 abstract = {This article compares the land surface temperature (LST) and sky view factor (SVF) as indicator of the impact of urban morphology on the urban heat island effect. For this purpose, the work investigates the dependence of this relationship to spatial resolutions varying from coarse to very fine and related scaling effect. For this purpose, several daytime Landsat 8, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer and airborne TASI-600 images acquired in different months of the year were used to retrieve LST. Moreover, a three-dimensional building vector database was used to produce SVF maps at different spatial resolutions, according to the thermal ones. The results show a positive relationship between LST and SVF; these trends are almost super-imposable for same-sensor images, but vary for images at different resolutions. This is likely due to the interference on the SVF and LST values of micro-scale factors, e.g. thermal properties of building materials, anthropogenic heat, humidity and pollutants, and others, which in a macro-scale analysis are smoothed becoming irrelevant. Therefore, a digital database able to represent urban features at suitable spatial scale is a requirement for a reliable analysis. In particular, when airborne thermal data are used, the lack of a reliable cartographic digital data could represent a limiting factor. Specifically, the data set used in the computation of SVF and other geographical parameters involved in the LST assessment should be consistent with the resolution of airborne thermal data. {\copyright} 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

The results presented here confirm some of the conclusions presented previously, including the benefit of mining large previously acquired digital data for archaeological information, the diversity of lowland settlement and features in between areas already well-documented, and the contribution to landscape archaeology of such transect samples when coupled to macro-environmental data sets. These data also fill in some details about the prehispanic Mesoamerican landscape, raising new questions about the relationship between past settlements and regional cultural, political, and ecological systems. Finally, these data offer important foundational inventories for discussing how to preserve and conserve archaeological resources across the lowlands, especially when these resources are not tied to monumental architecture. {\copyright} 2020 The Author(s)},

In order to obtain stable and reliable classification results, however, the application of pre-processing steps to digital terrain data is needed. This study examines semi-automated approaches to identification of archaeological features through a comparison of pixel-based and object-oriented data classification methods for archaeological feature detection in visualizations derived from high-resolution airborne laser scanning data. In doing so, openness is presented as a suitable visualization for feature detection due to its illumination-invariant representation of convexity and concavity in terrain data. The methodology of both pixel-based and object-oriented data classification approaches is described and applied to two datasets recorded over two archeological case study areas in Sweden and Austria. The diverse nature of the two datasets makes them ideal with regard to determining the robustness of the approaches discussed here. The obtained results are exported to a GIS environment and compared with manual visual interpretations and analyzed in terms of their accuracy. Therefore, this paper presents both a discussion regarding the merits of pixel- and object-based semi-automated classification strategies with regard to archaeological prospection data as well as practical examples of their implementation and results. {\copyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

Such field studies are typically based on limited temporal data, leaving uncertainty in the strength of observed relationships with controlling parameters over the long term. A deficiency of long-term data also prevents determination of the impact that multi-year or decadal climate patterns, such as the El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), might have on weathering fluxes. Here we analyze an 18-year hydrochemical dataset for eight sub-basins of the Panama Canal Watershed of high-temporal frequency collected between 1998 and 2015 to address these knowledge gaps. We identified a strongly positive covariance of both cation (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+) and suspended sediment yields with precipitation and extent of forest cover, whereas we observed negative relationships with temperature and mosaic landcover. We also confirmed a statistical relationship between seasonality, ENSO, and river discharge, with significantly higher values occurring during La Ni{\~n}a events. These findings emphasize the importance that long-term datasets have on identifying short-term influences on chemical and physical weathering rates, especially, in ENSO-influenced regions.},

 abstract = {This paper describes a new ensemble technique for road surface temperature (RST) forecasting using an energy balance and heat conduction model. Compared to currently used deterministic forecasts, the proposed technique allows the estimation of forecast uncertainty and probabilistic forecasts. The ensemble technique is applied to the METRo-CZ model and stems from error covariance analyses of the forecasted air temperature and humidity 2~m above the ground, wind speed at 10~m and total cloud cover N in octas by the numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. N is used to estimate the shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes. These variables are used to calculate the boundary conditions in the METRo-CZ model. We found that the variable N is crucial for generating the ensembles. Nevertheless, the ensemble spread is too small and underestimates the uncertainty in the RST forecast. One of the reasons is not considering errors in the rain and snow forecast by the NWP model when generating ensembles. Technical issues, such as incorrect sky view factors and the current state of road surface conditions also contribute to errors. Although the ensemble technique underestimates the uncertainty in the RST forecasts, it provides additional information to road authorities who provide winter road maintenance. {\copyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Sola.2014,
 abstract = {In the last years, many topographic correction (TOC) methods have been proposed to correct the illumination differences between the areas observed by optical remote sensors. Although the available number of TOC methods is high, the evaluation of their performance generally relies on the existence of precise land-cover information, and a standardized and objective evaluation procedure has not been proposed yet. In this paper, we propose an objective procedure to assess the accuracy of these TOC methods on the basis of simulated scenes, i.e., synthetically generated images. These images represent the radiance an optical sensor would receive under specific geometric and temporal acquisition conditions and assuming a certain land-cover type. A simplified method for creating synthetic images using the state-of-the-art irradiance models is proposed, both considering the real topography of a certain area [synthetic real (SR) image] or considering the relief of this area as being completely flat [synthetic horizontal image (SH)]. The comparison between the corrected image obtained by applying a TOC method to the SR and SH images of the same area, allows assessing the performance of each TOC algorithm. This comparison is quantitatively carried out using the structural similarity index. The proposed TOC evaluation procedure is applied to a specific case study in northern Spain to explain its implementation and demonstrate its potential. The procedure proposed in this paper could be also used to assess the behavior of TOC methods operating under different scenarios considering diverse topographic, geometrical, and temporal acquisition configurations. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

 abstract = {A new procedure to assess the quality of topographic correction (TOC) algorithms applied to remote sensing imagery was previously proposed by the authors. This procedure was based on a model that simulated synthetic scenes, representing the radiance an optical sensor would receive from an area under some specific conditions. TOC algorithms were then applied to synthetic scenes and the resulting corrected scenes were compared with a horizontal synthetic scene free of topographic effect. This comparison enabled an objective and quantitative evaluation of TOC algorithms. This approach showed promising results but had some shortcomings that are addressed herein. First, the model, originally built to simulate only broadband panchromatic scenes, is extended to multispectral scenes in the visible, near infrared (NIR), and short wave infrared (SWIR) bands. Next, the model is validated by comparing synthetic scenes with four Satellite pour l'Observation de la Terre 5 (SPOT5) real scenes acquired on different dates and different test areas along the Pyrenees mountain range (Spain). The results obtained show a successful simulation of all the spectral bands. Therefore, the model is deemed accurate enough for its purpose of evaluating TOC algorithms. {\copyright} 2015 by the authors.},

 abstract = {Archaeologists engaging with Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data rely heavily on manual inspection of various derived visualizations. However, manual inspection of ALS data is extremely time-consuming and as such presents a major bottleneck in the data analysis workflow. We have therefore set out to learn and test a deep neural network model for classifying from previously manually annotated ancient Maya structures of the Chact{\'u}n archaeological site in Campeche, Mexico. We considered several variations of the VGG-19 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to solve the task of classifying visualized example structures from previously manually annotated ALS images of man-made aguadas, buildings and platforms, as well as images of surrounding terrain (four classes and over 12,000 anthropogenic structures). We investigated how various parameters impact model performance, using: (a) six different visualization blends, (b) two different edge buffer sizes, (c) additional data augmentation and (d) architectures with different numbers of untrainable, frozen layers at the beginning of the network. Many of the models learned under the different scenarios exceeded the overall classification accuracy of 95{\%}. Using overall accuracy, terrain precision and recall (detection rate) per class of anthropogenic structure as criteria, we selected visualization with slope, sky-view factor and positive openness in separate bands; image samples with a two-pixels edge buffer; Keras data augmentation; and five frozen layers as the optimal combination of building blocks for learning our CNN model. {\copyright} 2020 by the authors.},

@article{Sonnemann.2016,
 abstract = {The archaeology of Amerindian settlements in the Caribbean has mostly been identified through scatters of artefacts; predominantly conglomerations of shells, ceramics and lithics. While archaeological material may not always be visible on the surface, particular settlement patterns may be identifiable by a topography created through cultural action: earthen mounds interchanging with mostly circular flattened areas. In northern Hispaniola, recent foot surveys have identified more than 200 pre-colonial sites of which several have been mapped in high resolution. In addition, three settlements with topographical characteristics have been extensively excavated, confirming that the mounds and flattened areas may have had a cultural connotation in this region. Without the availability of high resolution LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data, a photogrammetric approach using UAS (unmanned aircraft system, commonly known as drones) can fill the knowledge gap on a local scale, providing fast and reliable data collection and precise results. After photogrammetric processing, digital clearance of vegetation, and extraction of the georeferenced DEM (digital elevation model) and orthophoto, filters and enhancements provide an opportunity to visualize the results in GIS. The outcome provides an overview of site size, and distribution of mounds and flattened areas. Measurement of the topographic changes in a variety of past settlements defines likely zones of habitat, and provides clues on the actual dimensions and density of living space. Understanding the relation of the mounds and adjacent flat areas within their environment allows a discussion on how, and for what purpose, the settlement was founded at a particular location, and provides clues about its spatial organization. {\copyright} 2016 by the authors.},

Based on ALS (lidar) data, which were acquired for a broader area of 230 km2 and revealed a thoroughly modified and undisturbed archaeological landscape, and on additional information provided by subsequent field surveys and test excavations, we focus on the techniques of water management and agricultural intensification reflected in specific types of landscape modifications. By analyzing their characteristics, distribution and chronology, we discuss their practical functions, which in the region characterized by the lack of permanent water sources were of foremost importance, and further infer the sociopolitical structures involved in their construction and maintenance. We also interpret the significance of these features in Maya worldview and ritual and their role in landscape construction and conceptualization, and show their potential for addressing other fundamental questions of archaeological relevance, including population estimates, settlement dynamics, and the processes that led to the final demise of Classic Maya culture in the central lowlands. {\copyright} 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

 abstract = {The article uses a 3D imaging based solution where surface shading is determined by surface geometry. It is applied to inscribed stone surfaces in order to examine lettering and other carvings dated to the 5th - 9th centuries AD. Mid-range terrestrial laser scanning and structure from motion (SfM) based photogrammetry were cross-examined in order to create a low cost, but nevertheless highly accurate solution to 3D imaging that requires a computer, a camera, open source software like CloudCompare and a SfM based service called Photo located at ReCap360.autodesk.com. Ambient occlusion (AO) shading was used to show improvements made to the SfM data, which was achieved by adding known parameters to all photographs used. It simulates the direct light components of a light source so that exposed areas appear lightened and enclosed areas (like crevices and incisions) appear darkened. In the case study, AO was used to differentiate lettering in the inscription from damage and weathering on the granite surface of the Tristan Stone, as well as picking up a previously unnoticed wheel-head cross. This particular inscribed stone is located near Fowey in Cornwall, UK, and was known as the Long Stone before its name was changed on British Ordnance Survey (OS) Maps in 1951. The Tristan Stone was the first artefact to be scanned by the FARO Focus3D laser scanner after its release in 2010. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Although the benefit that green areas give to natural cooling is well known, this kind of studies has hardly been carried out, especially at an urban scale where it is crucial to define quantities and density of green areas to address open spaces design. To reach this goal, a methodology based on the interpretation of the statistical correlation among temperature, urban parameters and green areas configurational indicators was implemented and applied to the case study of the Municipality of Naples, performing all the analysis in a GIS.

 abstract = {In this methodological paper, the authors want to show the interest of crossing planform analysis with the study of relief anomalies and sedimentological record in order to describe both spatial and temporal evolution on a Loire river's loodplain section at plurimillenial scale. Using a set of georeferenced then digitalized maps and photographs, planform changes are quantiied at centennial scale with morphometric parameters. his approach of active channel's evolution is then extended to the whole alluvial plain. Relative chronology of the main steps of loodplain's construction is deduced from surface topographic anomalies. In the aim of reducing river's slope efects, a reference plan based on channel water is subtracted from the LiDAR DEM (Digital Elevation Model). he result of such an operation is a representation of the loodplain's relative altitude, which leads to enlighten several classes of abandoned channels and their active belts. hese sequences, where the sedimentological record has embedded the loodplain's history, are then described on cores and trenches at pertinent points. Geometry of the deposits is reined using tomographic electrical resistivity. A systematic use of radiocarbon dating gives absolute ages to the main steps of alluvial plain's construction. he results obtained are then synthetized and reveal the main transformations of the luvial system during the last past millennia. he changes are mainly driven by Holocene climatic variations like the LIA (Little Ice Age), last major degradation that had an important role in the genesis of current European alluvial landscapes. In sum, the integrated approach allows to describe rhythm, intensity and response time at the Holocene valley scale, and can be used whatever the river considered. {\copyright} 2017 GFG Editions - Tous droits r{\'e}serv{\'e}s.},

 abstract = {Recent remote sensing research in the Tlalixcoyan basin, Veracruz, has identified patterns of raised fields and public civic-ceremonial plaza groups that suggest a local and decentralized strategy of cooperation to develop hydraulic and agricultural resources. This perspective provides support for Scarborough and Lucero's (2010) cross-cultural conceptualization of hydraulic strategies in the semi-tropics, but we note some exceptions to their model as well. We conclude based on the remotely sensed data that (1) most of the interconnected field systems are too large or complex for a single family or lineage to have built and maintained alone; (2) the Tlalixcoyan settlement system is divided into clusters that likely represent social groupings akin to administrative districts; (3) each residential cluster possessed its own public civic-ceremonial plaza group; (4) each plaza group could have provided the seat of cooperation in the creation and maintenance of common-pool resources like raised fields; and (5) despite the implication of local hydraulic management within districts, the region as a whole presents a hierarchical settlement distribution with the Tlalixcoyan Monumental Complex at the top. The last two points represent central hypotheses generated from the remote sensing data that will be tested in future field research. {\copyright} 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

To manage and mitigate these risks, we require knowledge about what has been lost and what remains, so we can actively decide what should be investigated and what should be preserved for the future. Remote sensing provides archaeologists with some of the tools we need to do this. In this paper we explore the application of multitemporal, multisensor data to map features and chart the impacts of urban encroachment on the ancient city of Jerash (in modern Jordan) by combining archives of aerial photography dating back to 1917 with state-of-the-art airborne laser scanning. The combined results revealed details of the water distribution system and the ancient city plan. This demonstrates that by combining historical images with modern aerial and ground-based data we can successfully detect and contextualize these features and thus achieve a better understanding of life in a city in the past. These methods are essential, given that much of the ancient city has been lost to modern development and the historical imagery is often our only source of information.},

Nevertheless, large-coverage, intermediate-resolution DEMs are still largely used, and can be the ideal choice in several applications based on the processing of spatially-integrated information. In 2012 the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia opened a website for the free download of the ``TINTALY'' Digital Elevation Model (DEM), which covers the whole Italian territory. Since then, about 700 users from 28 different countries have been accredited for data download, and a report of 4~years of data dissemination and use is presented. The analysis of the intended use reveals that the 10~m-resolution, seamless TINITALY DEM is of use for an extremely assorted research community. Accredited users are working in virtually any branch of the Earth Sciences (e.g. Volcanology, Seismology, and Geomorphology), in spatially integrated humanities (e.g. History and Archaeology), and in other thematic areas such as in applied Physics and Zoology. Many users are also working in local administrations (e.g. Regions and Municipalities) for civil protection or land use planning purposes. In summary, the documented activity shows that the dissemination of seamless, large coverage elevation datasets can fertilize the technological progress of the whole society providing a significant benefit to stakeholders. {\copyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Ther.2020,
 abstract = {The article discusses the various options for reconstructing pottery-forming techniques and for making reliable interpretations of forming practices based on archaeological evidence. It begins with a consideration of a classification of forming techniques that provides a framework with a suitable resolution within which observed phenomena can be understood. Such a classification should reflect meaningful distinctions among the forming practices: (a) in terms of the potter's behaviour and also (b) in terms of the visibility of the effects in the archaeological record. The description of the forming practice reflects the fact that the forming method is a complex series of actions and often comprises more than one technique. The individual techniques are combined in two ways: (a) sequential, to create a single part, and (b) segmental, to create different parts. The relevant diagnostic attributes of pottery-forming practices are related to the structure and shape/size of the ceramics. They can be divided into five categories: (a) surface morphology and topography, (b) variation in the wall thickness, (c) remnants of segmental joints, (d) specific fractures, and (e) alignment and orientation of the components of the ceramic body. Two sources of misinterpretation of the diagnostic features define two types of ambiguous diagnostic features: (a) features that are correlated with a particular technique but are not necessarily a consequence of this technique and (b) features that are a necessary consequence of a particular technique but could also be a consequence of another technique. The analysis is intended to sufficiently narrow the range of possible alternatives by excluding those alternatives that cannot be the cause of the observed phenomena. Many features are randomly preserved on a small proportion of the pottery fragments, and thus, it is difficult to draw statistical inferences based on the evidence of these features. One diagnostic feature is prominent in this respect---the orientation of the components of the ceramic body. This can be observed and measured for every ceramic fragment. The analytical methods comprise direct visual observation and various imaging methods. Direct visual observation is carried out at three scales: macro, meso, and micro. Different scales of observation bring different types of information. Their use in combination is optimum for a reliable analysis. Various imaging methods can display what is difficult or even impossible to observe directly or what is observable at the cost of a destructive impact on the studied object. The image data can represent either the surfaces of the investigated objects or their internal structure, and 2D or 3D techniques are used in both cases. The observations related to pottery forming are most commonly classified or described in a given set of qualitative categories. The advantage of the qualitative approach is that the complex phenomena can be captured using appropriately defined categories. The quantitative approach relies on a measurable parameter or set of parameters to characterize the diagnostic features. The exact measurements have the potential to refine the analysis based on descriptive categories and create a stronger basis for scientific argumentation. However, in many cases, quantification reduces the complexity of the diagnostic features to just several aspects that can be measured. Therefore, it is important to combine the strengths of both of these approaches. {\copyright} 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

@article{Thompson.2020,
 abstract = {In the past decade, Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) has fundamentally changed our ability to remotely detect archaeological features and deepen our understanding of past human-environment interactions, settlement systems, agricultural practices, and monumental constructions. Across archaeological contexts, lidar relief visualization techniques test how local environments impact archaeological prospection. This study used a 132 km2 lidar dataset to assess three relief visualization techniques---sky-view factor (SVF), topographic position index (TPI), and simple local relief model (SLRM)---and object-based image analysis (OBIA) on a slope model for the non-automated visual detection of small hinterland Classic (250--800 CE) Maya settlements near the polities of Uxbenk{\'a} and Ix Kuku'il in Southern Belize. Pedestrian survey in the study area identified 315 plazuelas across a 35 km2 area; the remaining 90 km2 in the lidar dataset is yet to be surveyed. The previously surveyed plazuelas were compared to the plazuelas visually identified on the TPI and SLRM. In total, an additional 563 new possible plazuelas were visually identified across the lidar dataset, using TPI and SLRM. Larger plazuelas, and especially plazuelas located in disturbed environments, are often more likely to be detected in a visual assessment of the TPI and SLRM. These findings emphasize the extent and density of Classic Maya settlements and highlight the continued need for pedestrian survey to ground-truth remotely identified archaeological features and the impact of modern anthropogenic behaviors for archaeological prospection. Remote sensing and lidar have deepened our understanding of past human settlement systems and low-density urbanism, processes that we experience today as humans residing in modern cities. {\copyright} 2020 by the author.

 abstract = {What can remote sensing contribute to archaeological surveying in subarctic and arctic landscapes? The pros and cons of remote sensing data vary as do areas of utilization and methodological approaches. We assessed the applicability of remote sensing for archaeological surveying of northern landscapes using airborne laser scanning (LiDAR) and satellite and aerial images to map archaeological features as a basis for a) assessing the pros and cons of the different approaches and b) assessing the potential detection rate of remote sensing. Interpretation of images and a LiDAR-based bare-earth digital terrain model (DTM) was based on visual analyses aided by processing and visualizing techniques. 368 features were identified in the aerial images, 437 in the satellite images and 1186 in the DTM. LiDAR yielded the better result, especially for hunting pits. Image data proved suitable for dwellings and settlement sites. Feature characteristics proved a key factor for detectability, both in LiDAR and image data. This study has shown that LiDAR and remote sensing image data are highly applicable for archaeological surveying in northern landscapes. It showed that a multi-sensor approach contributes to high detection rates. Our results have improved the inventory of archaeological sites in a non-destructive and minimally invasive manner. {\copyright} 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

 abstract = {Context: Both urban two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) morphology can affect air and land surface temperature. While many studies have looked at the impact of horizontal morphology, few have explored the relationship between vertical morphology and temperature, especially at the neighborhood scale. Objectives: This study aims to answer two questions: (1) Does air temperature vary in neighborhoods with different morphology? (2) If so, how does the 2D (horizontal) and 3D (vertical) morphology affect air temperature? Methods: We examined the relationship between morphology and air temperature for 24 residential neighborhoods in Beijing, using correlation analysis, regression analysis, and structural equation modeling. Morphological indicators were derived from remotely sensed land cover and light detecting and ranging (LiDAR) point cloud data. Air temperature was continuously measured using HOBO data loggers during the summer of 2014. Results: Nighttime air temperature was higher in neighborhoods dominated by high-rise structures compared to neighborhoods dominated by low-rise structures suggesting that 3D morphology is more important than 2D morphology in predicting air temperature. The ratio of vegetation volume to building volume negatively correlated with average air temperature and daytime temperature, while the mean distance among adjacent buildings had a positive effect. Building height was the most important predictor of nighttime air temperature. The major determinants of air temperature in high-rise and low-rise neighborhoods were different. Conclusions: Both 2D and 3D morphology can affect air temperature in residential neighborhoods. Increasing vegetation volume relative to building volume and decreasing the distance among buildings can reduce daytime air temperatures. {\copyright} 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

 abstract = {The aim of this article is to analyze the spatial clustering of pottery finds based on their occurrence at different depths in the Pobedim hillfort archaeological site (Western Slovakia), without reference to stratigraphic data. Two fuzzy sets methods (fuzzy linear function and fuzzy gamma operator) were used to analyze the distribution of Slavic pottery from the 9th century AD at six sectors (I--VI) located at the acropolis of the Pobedim hillfort in terms of their occurrence at different depths, their quantity at different depths, and the number of excavation pits. Using the mentioned fuzzy set methods, significant clusters of pottery were found in two sectors of the Pobedim site (sectors I and II). The results were compared with those obtained in previous research at this site, where the method of spatial autocorrelation was used. It was found that the most significant squares identified with the use of fuzzy set theory coincide with 14 squares where auto-correlation also found significant concentrations of pottery. However, the most significant squares identified by fuzzy methods (in the range 0.7--1) in all sectors of the Pobedim hillfort were 16{\%} less than those identified by the positive spatial autocorrelation. {\copyright} 2021 by the authors.

The aim of the present study was to develop a new quantitative LD mapping approach using machine learning techniques, benchmark models, and human-induced and socio-environmental variables. We employed four machine learning algorithms [Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), and Dragonfly Algorithm (DA)] for LD risk mapping, based on topographic (n = 7), human-induced (n = 5), and geo-environmental (n = 6) variables, and field measurements of degradation in the Pole-Doab watershed, Iran. We assessed the performance of different algorithms using receiver operating characteristic, Kappa index, and Taylor diagram. The results revealed that the main topographic, geoenvironmental, and human-induced variable was slope, geology, and land use change, respectively. Assessments of model performance indicated that DA had the highest accuracy and efficiency, with the greatest learning and prediction power in LD risk mapping. In LD risk maps produced using SVM, GLM, MARS, and DA, 19.16{\%}, 19.29{\%}, 21.76{\%}, and 22.40{\%}, respectively, of total area in the Pole-Doab watershed had a very high degradation risk. The results of this study demonstrate that in LD risk mapping for a region, topographic, and geological factors (static conditions) and human activities (dynamic conditions, e.g., residential and industrial area expansion) should be considered together, for best protection at watershed scale. These findings can help policymakers prioritize land and water conservation efforts. {\copyright} 2020, The Author(s).},

@article{Toumazet.2017,
 abstract = {The use of Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) for archaeological purposes is becoming more prevalent in order to detect and to document remains located in forested areas. One of the main interests of airborne laser scanning is to put the archaeological information in their context, and to allow a better understanding of the relation between each item and its environment. This concept of archaeological landscape generally results in a too large amount of data to permit a manual analysis. This paper describes an approach for the automatic detection of elementary archaeological grazing structures, found in high concentration in some places of Auvergne (France). These elementary structures are generally connected, creating complex archaeological grazing sets. The detection process is based on the design of a model of an elementary grazing structure. The automatic detection is then carried out, based on the evaluation of the matching degree of each element with the model and on their belonging to complex archaeological grazing structures. The efficiency of the method is tested, by comparison with the manual digitalisation of an expert, on a restricted zone, and the results show that the success rate of the automatic detection reaches higher values than classical template matching approaches. The additional criterion, based on the belonging of each elementary structure to a more complex one, improves the detection success: In a complementary way, this approach offers new opportunities: it is also possible to detect complex structures with a template matching approach, if they contain some simple forms, that can be modelled. {\copyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {This study quantified the relationship among deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (DGSDs), landslides, and river rejuvenation in the upper reaches of the Kumano River in the Kii Mountains of Japan, an area of frequent bedrock landslides. River profiles and hillslope landforms were examined, and high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) were used to identify DGSDs and landslides. Many of the deep-seated landslides were associated with rainstorms in 1889 and 2011. Landslide volumes were related to landslide areas on the basis of 52 deep-seated landslides that failed during the 2011 rainfall, providing basic data for landscape denudation and sediment yield. River rejuvenation occurred stepwise, incising moderate relief paleosurfaces and forming two series of knickpoints and V-shaped inner gorges that are up to 400-m deep. More than 65{\%} of DGSDs and 75{\%} of the landslides were located in association with the incised inner gorges along the peripheries of the paleosurfaces or were entirely contained within the inner gorges. DGSDs and landslides associated with the incised inner valley slopes tended to be larger than those developed within the paleosurfaces and may be long-term transient hillslope responses to river incision. Hillslope undercutting caused by rejuvenated river incision may play an important role in long-term slope stability and distribution of mass movements, and could serve as an indicator of landslide hazard. {\copyright} 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Therefore, there is a need to monitor landscape relicts that mark our past. This study examines depressions caused by shelling. These shell holes are still present today and are one of the last remains of the military impact during the 4~years long stalemate on the Western Front. Shell hole landscapes are until now overlooked in landscape research and little attention is given to the causes behind the absence or presence of these shell holes in the present-day micro-topography. This paper aims to identify these causes by using digital interdisciplinary techniques on a landscape scale: Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) giving insights into the presence of the shell holes today, landscape maps indicating the evolution of land use/land cover in the past century and a shell hole density map representing the situation of 1918. Results revealed that the WWI shell hole landscape is still abundantly present today, and where it has disappeared, a direct link was found to land use/land cover transformations and the intensity level of cultivated fields from past to present. To work towards a sustainable management of WWI heritage, these findings are indispensable. {\copyright} 2018, {\copyright} 2018 The Royal Danish Geographical Society.},

@article{vandenEeckhaut.2012,
 abstract = {In contrast to the many studies that use expert-based analysis of LiDAR derivatives for landslide mapping in forested terrain, only few studies have attempted to develop (semi-)automatic methods for extracting landslides from LiDAR derivatives. While all these studies are pixel-based, it has not yet been tested whether object-oriented analysis (OOA) could be an alternative. This study investigates the potential of OOA using only single-pulse LiDAR derivatives, such as slope gradient, roughness and curvature to map landslides. More specifically, the focus is on both LiDAR data segmentation and classification of slow-moving landslides in densely vegetated areas, where spectral data do not allow accurate landslide identification. A multistage procedure has been developed and tested in the Flemish Ardennes (Belgium). The procedure consists of (1) image binarization and multiresolution segmentation, (2) classification of landslide parts (main scarps and landslide body segments) and non-landslide features (i.e. earth banks and cropland fields) with supervised support vector machines at the appropriate scale, (3) delineation of landslide flanks, (4) growing of a landslide body starting from its main scarp, and (5) final cleaning of the inventory map. The results obtained show that OOA using LiDAR derivatives allows recognition and characterization of profound morphologic properties of forested deep-seated landslides on soil-covered hillslopes, because more than 90{\%} of the main scarps and 70{\%} of the landslide bodies of an expert-based inventory were accurately identified with OOA. For mountainous areas with bedrock, on the other hand, creation of a transferable model is expected to be more difficult. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {The Amsterwarm project investigates the urban heat island of Amsterdam, the vulnerability of its population, the energy efficiency of its buildings and landuse. A novel mapping approach provides insights into the questions of what causes the urban heat island and who will be affected by it. Landuse does affect the surface temperature. The difference between the areas in the city with the least and the greatest impervious surface coverage accounts for an average land surface temperature difference of 11.6 per hectare. The study demonstrates furthermore that the vulnerability of people and buildings to the urban heat island effect is a local condition in which the energy efficiency of buildings, quality of life and demographic factors should all be considered in an approach that is sensitive to place.Practical application: The typological maps will allow local authorities to prioritise adaptive actions in urban planning in response to the urban heat island, an emerging climate-related challenge that has a significant impact on the comfort and health of its citizens and on the (future) energy use required for cooling buildings. Raising the albedo in those areas of the city that are dominated by impervious surface cover seems an effective adaptation strategy, suitable to a city such as Amsterdam that no longer builds on green field sites but only builds as possible within the envelope of the existing city. Improving the quality of life in neighbourhoods and the energy efficiency/climate proofing of the building stock could also be prioritised in the identified neighbourhoods. {\copyright} The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.},

 abstract = {Climate scientists forecast that heat waves will occur more often in the Netherlands in the coming decades. The Hotterdam study accordingly measured urban heat and modelled the surface energy balance in the Dutch city of Rotterdam. It identified in detail the city's social, morphological, and land-use dimensions using a geographic information system (GIS), 3D models, and satellite images. It used hierarchical and multivariate regression analyses to determine the links between temperatures and the surface energy balance on the one hand, and social, morphological, and land-use aspects on the other. The Hotterdam study did establish a link between the urban heat island effect in Rotterdam and the health of its population. It also statistically explained the high rate of mortality among seniors seventy-five and over during the summer of 2006. The spatial concentration of senior citizens, the average age of the buildings they live in, and the sum of the sensible heat flux and storage heat flux play a large role. Imperviousness, the leaf area index, the building envelope, surface water, and shade are the dimensions that best explained the Rotterdam urban heat island. We mapped these aspects in two heat-maps that help in setting priorities for implementing climate adaptation measures. {\copyright} 2018 Urban Planning Institute of the Republic of Slovenia.

 abstract = {Hillshaded digital elevation models are a well-known information layer used to determine the geomorphological properties of landslides. However, their use is limited because the results are dependent on a particular sun azimuth and elevation. Approaches proposed to overcome this bias include positive openness, sky-view factor, red relief image maps, and prismatic openness. We propose an upgrade to all these methods, a method named Visualization for Archaeological Topography (VAT). The method is based on a fusion of four information layers into a single image (hillshaded terrain, slope, positive openness, and sky-view factor). VAT can be used to enhance visibility of features of varied scale, height, orientation, and form that sit on terrain ranging from extremely flat to very steep. Besides this, the merits of VAT are that the results are comparable across diverse geographical areas. We have successfully tested the method for landslide recognition and analysis in five different areas in the Vipava Valley (SW Slovenia). Geomorphology of the area is very diverse and holds various types of mass movements. In contrast to classical hillshaded digital elevation models (DEMs), the geomorphological features of landslides obtained by the VAT method are very clearly seen in all studied mass movements. {\copyright} 2019 by the authors.},

 abstract = {In various disciplines, particularly those that utilise techniques developed in the geosciences, the display, analysis and interpretation of three-dimensional (3D) data is very important. This is also the case in archaeology. Irrespective of a site- or landscape-centred point of focus, archaeology deals with very complex surfaces and always examines traces of past human presence in three geometrical dimensions. Visualising these detailed geometric environments is not that much of an issue anymore; however, interactively interpreting and mapping them is still problematic. Despite the steady increase in technologies to create 3D models, there is still a serious lack of tools that allow for easy interaction with these models in a metrical and coordinate system-aware environment. As a result, most---if not all---interpretation workflows will first downscale 3D data to two-and-a-half-dimensional (2.5D) or 2D data sets, thus effectively discarding up to one geometrical dimension. To enable or enhance the perception of topographic characteristics in these geometrically compromised datasets, various visualisation techniques have been developed to artificially restore and enhance the data that was initially discarded. While these techniques work very well to enhance the remaining pertinent features present in such data sets, data downscaling can nevertheless irrevocably eliminate significant amounts of important archaeological information. Therefore, this paper outlines a new processing and interpretation pipeline for complex archaeological 3D surfaces that do not rely on downscaling of data, while also discussing several 3D-related concepts and issues along the way. More specifically, this article focusses on the generation of intelligently decimated, two-manifold triangular meshes and the subsequent geo-referenced 3D interpretative mapping of these surfaces. Furthermore, all applications can be considered low- and even no-cost, making this a readily implemented processing and interpretation workflow. Additionally, all software packages are easy to learn and flexible enough for implementation in any existing mixed software pipeline. {\copyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

 abstract = {The large-scale deployment of photovoltaics (PV) on building rooftops can play a significant role in the transition to a low-carbon energy system. To date, the lack of high-resolution building and environmental data and the large uncertainties related to existing processing methods impede the accurate estimation of large-scale rooftop PV potentials. To address this gap, we developed a methodology that combines Machine Learning algorithms, Geographic Information Systems and physical models to estimate the technical PV potential for individual roof surfaces at hourly temporal resolution. We further estimate the uncertainties related to each step of the potential assessment and combine them to quantify the uncertainty on the final PV potential. The methodology is applied to 9.6 million rooftops in Switzerland and can be transferred to any large region or country with sufficient available data. Our results suggest that 55{\%} of the total Swiss roof surface is available for the installation of PV panels, yielding an annual technical rooftop PV potential of 24$\pm$9TWh. This could meet more than 40{\%} of Switzerland's current annual electricity demand. The presented method for an hourly rooftop PV potential and uncertainty estimation can be applied to the large-scale assessment of future energy systems with decentralised electricity grids. The results can be used to propose effective policies for the integration of rooftop photovoltaics in the built environment. {\copyright} 2020 The Authors},

 abstract = {Downward shortwave radiation (DSR) plays a very important role in land surface radiation budget and land-surface processes modeling. Although there are several radiation products developed based on satellite observations, the coarse spatial resolution greatly limits their applications in regional or local scales. To get high-resolution and accuracy-reliable DSR data, a practical downscaling method for clear-sky condition was proposed by using the scale-invariant relationship of the radiative transfer process to decompose the global radiation into direct and diffuse components at horizontal level and conducting topographic correction finally. Based on this method, the time series of Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) DSR product covering part of Navarre province in the northern Spain was disaggregated into 30-m level with the use of the ALOS World 3D-30m digital elevation model (DEM) data. The downscaled results not only presented high spatial heterogeneity with respect to the changes in surface topography but also showed reasonable values at different times over different days in one year. The in situ validation indicated that the hourly downscaled DSR had quite high correlation with the surface measurements at each day with the coefficient of determination above 0.97 and the root-mean-squared error lower than 35 W/m2. Overall, the evaluation allows concluding on the proposed method that can be a good way to get reliable and high-resolution DSR data from coarse-resolution DSR product under clear-sky condition. {\copyright} 1980-2012 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Downward surface solar radiation (DSSR) plays an important role in the earth's surface energy budget. However, it has significant spatialoral heterogeneity over the rugged terrain. To accurately capture DSSR, many analytical terrain parameter algorithms based on digital elevation models (DEMs) have been proposed. However, the uncertainties of the DSSR components associated with these algorithms remain unclear. In this letter, we compared three types of terrain parameter algorithms and their respective DSSR component uncertainties at different spatial scales by using 3-D discrete anisotropic radiative model simulations under different atmospheric conditions. The comparison results indicated that differences in slopes, sky view factors, and terrain view factors can be up to 4°, 0.165°, and 0.264°, respectively. For a high atmospheric visibility, the maximum discrepancies of direct solar irradiance and adjacent terrain-reflected irradiance over the high reflective surface (e.g., fresh snow and ice) are 26.7 and 42.8 W m2, respectively. In addition, for a low atmospheric visibility, a maximum difference of 31 W m2 is identified for diffuse skylight. These uncertainties are nonnegligible when using a high-resolution DEM (e.g., 30 m), but as the DEM resolution becomes coarser, the uncertainties decrease. {\copyright} 2018 IEEE.},

@article{Wu.2019,
 abstract = {Large-scale spatiotemporal variations in land surface temperature (LST) can be derived from satellite observations, particularly for remote high-elevated mountain glaciers where in situ observations are scarce. Our previous LST retrieval study on Qiyi Glacier of China employed a generalized single-channel algorithm and Landsat thermal infrared data, but a clear LST summertime overestimation was observed, particularly on the glacier tongue. Here we extend our previous study by calculating the thermal radiance on Qiyi Glacier that is emitted from the surrounding terrain, and incorporating this thermal radiation term into two generalized single-channel LST algorithms to analyze its influence on the errors of glacier surface temperatures retrieved from remote sensing data. In addition, we also discuss other possible causes of this overestimation in LST retrieval. The key findings of our study are as follows. (1) The surrounding terrain provides nonnegligible summertime thermal radiation to the glacier in the Landsat7 band 6 spectrum range (10.4--12.5 \textgreek{m}m) that is 2.6 times larger than the atmospheric down-welling thermal radiance on the glacier tongue. The retrieved LSTs yield an overestimation of up to 0.28 K when the effect of thermal radiation from the surrounding slopes is not considered. (2) The average errors due to the surrounding topographic thermal radiation and the cubic convolution resampling method (CC method) employed in the Landsat7 thermal infrared data processing are only 0.07 K and $-$ 0.01 K, respectively. These are much smaller than the average LST errors (1.79 K), indicating that the neither the surrounding topographic thermal radiation nor the CC method are primary factors in the retrieved LST overestimation. (3) The sole dependence of the generalized single-channel algorithm on the atmospheric water vapor content may therefore be the most likely cause of this overestimation, as high-altitude regions generally possess low atmospheric water contents. Radiative transfer models (e.g., MODTRAN) may provide a solution to this problem by simulating the influence of other atmospheric constituents on LST retrieval under conditions of low water vapor, which can then indicate any additional input variables that should be incorporated into the LST algorithm. {\copyright} 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

 abstract = {Recently, light use efficiency (LUE) models have been widely used for calculating gross primary productivity (GPP). Unfortunately, these models are only suitable for flat areas without considering the topographic effects on plant photosynthesis. In this study, considering the topographic controls on direct radiation, diffuse radiation, and sunlit canopy area, an adjusted model called mountainous two-leaf (MTL)-LUE is developed from the original two-leaf LUE model (TL-LUE) to improve the GPP simulations in mountainous areas. The MTL-LUE model was validated at an eddy covariance (EC) site with apparent topography in the carbon footprint area. Results showed that the daily GPP simulations from MTL-LUE (root mean square error~=~1.29~gC~m$-$2~d$-$1) matched better with EC GPP than those from the TL-LUE model (root mean square error~=~1.84~gC~m$-$2~d$-$1), confirming the improvement of the MTL-LUE model in mountainous areas. Moreover, results also indicated that the MTL-LUE-simulated GPP showed obvious spatial variations in the study area, suggesting that the MTL-LUE model could characterize the effects of topography on plant photosynthesis. More specifically, canopy GPP was found to decrease when slope increased in shaded terrains and has no obvious variations in different slope ranges when exposed to the sun. Furthermore, results also indicated that a moderate increase in canopy GPP would be expected when the sky clearness decreased, which depended on the gap between the GPP increase of shaded leaves and the GPP decrease of sunlit leaves. This study highlights the potential of the MTL-LUE model in improving GPP simulations in mountainous areas. {\copyright}2020. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

 abstract = {Surface emissivity is a critical parameter for studying city-, meso-, and micro-scale climate and energy balance. The emissivity of complex surfaces e.g. a forest or an urban canopy is an effective surface property since it depends on both surface materials and geometry. This study presents a novel methodology for estimating effective emissivity using sky view factor retrieved from airborne Lidar data, building GIS data, and land use and land cover classification data. First, a high correlation between the effective emissivity retrieved from ASTER TIR bands 10-14 and the sky view factor was observed (r2=0.93, 0.99, 0.99, 0.97, 0.97). When the sky view factor decreases, the effective emissivity tends to increase, which is mainly due to multiple scattering (cavity effect), thus increases the effective emissivity. A simplified model which assumes that reflection and scattering only occurs within a single pixel was developed. Results showed that the correlations between the modeled and the spectral (band) emissivity retrieved from the ASTER multispectral TIR data (five spectral bands) are high (r2=0.93, 0.99, 0.98, 0.93, 0.97), and with low RMSE (0.019, 0.016, 0.012, 0.003 and 0.004 from band 10-14 respectively). The emissivity derived from this simplified model, however, tends to be overestimated in band 10-12. Thus, a refined urban emissivity model based on sky view factor (UEM-SVF) which considers the scattering and reflection from adjacent pixels was developed in this study. Results show a good agreement with ASTER spectral (band) emissivity: r2=0.90, 0.98, 0.96, 0.94 and 0.96, and very low RMSE (0.006, 0.003, 0.004, 0.002 and 0.004). This study illustrates that the UEM-SVF can be useful for estimation of land surface emissivity of complex surfaces, and can further be used for accurate land surface temperature retrieval. {\copyright} 2015 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

 abstract = {This study presents a Single Channel Method using Urban Exitance Model (UEM-SCM) to retrieve land surface temperature (LST) from satellite data in an urbanized city, and evaluates the geometry effect on land surface temperature retrieval using single channel method and split-window algorithm. The UEM-SCM incorporates the effect of urban geometry and considers both reflection caused by the target pixel and its neighboring pixels. In order to evaluate the geometry effect, the retrieved LSTs with and without geometry effect were studied. Results show that the LSTs without geometry effect are generally higher than the LSTs with geometry effect. The temperature difference occurs because the material emissivity is always lower than the effective emissivity caused by multiple scattering and reflection in urban areas (cavity effect). The LST without geometry effect also cannot fully capture the variability and complexity of urban thermal patterns. The temperature difference between with and without the geometry effect can reach 2 K in built-up areas. A comparison was also conducted between LST retrieved by split-window algorithm with and without geometry effect. Results show that the LST retrieved by split-window algorithm without geometry effect has generally higher values than the one with the geometry effect, e.g. 1.1 K on average and 1.5-2 K in built-up areas. The geometry effect will be removed and mis-deemed as atmospheric effect when the split-window algorithm without geometry effect is applied in urban areas. The split-window algorithm with the geometry effect can be used to distinguish between geometry and atmospheric effect in further study. {\copyright} 2015 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

@article{Yang.2016,
 abstract = {This study aims to evaluate the effects of urban geometry on retrieval of emissivity and surface temperature in urban areas. An improved urban emissivity model based on sky view factor (IUEM-SVF) was further enhanced to consider all radiance contributions leaving the urban canopy, including (i) emission by all facets within an instantaneous field of view (IFOV); (ii) reflection by all facets of emission from surrounding facets; and (iii) propagation of emitted and reflected radiation with multiple reflections (scattering) within a complex 3D array of urban objects. The effective emissivity derived from IUEM-SVF was evaluated with a microscale radiative transfer and energy balance model: Temperatures of Urban Facets in 3-D (TUF-3D). IUEM-SVF performs well when urban facets have uniform emissivity and temperature; e.g., root mean square deviations (RMSD) are less than 0.005 when material emissivity is larger than 0.80 (ɛ~⩾~0.80). However, when material emissivities are variable within the observed target, differences of effective emissivity between IUEM-SVF and TUF-3D become larger, e.g., RMSD of 0.010. When the effect of geometry is not considered and a mixed pixel emissivity is defined, the difference is even much larger (i.e. 0.02) and this difference increases with the decrease of sky view factor. Thus, the geometry effect should be considered in the determination of effective emissivity. Effective emissivity derived from IUEM-SVF was used to retrieve urban surface temperature from a nighttime ASTER thermal infrared image. Promising results were achieved in comparison with standard LST products retrieved with the Temperature and Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm. IUEM-SVF shows promise as a means to improve the accuracy of urban surface temperature retrieval. The effect of thermal heterogeneity on the effective emissivity was also evaluated by TUF-3D, and results show that the thermal heterogeneity cannot be neglected since the RMSD between the effective emissivity based on TUF-3D and IUEM-SVF is relatively large. {\copyright} 2016 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

 abstract = {Two different land surface temperatures (with considering geometry effect and without considering geometry effect) were derived to estimate sensible heat flux over urban areas using remotely sensed land surface temperature. Results showed that the surface temperatures with considering geometry effect could bring up to 18.0{\%} difference in the estimated sensible heat flux over built-up areas. The sensible heat fluxes derived from surface temperature with considering geometry effect were lower than those without considering geometry effect, particularly over built-up areas (e.g., the mean value is 44.3 Wm-). The sensible heat fluxes over built-up areas are higher than those over flat impervious surfaces. In addition to the anthropogenic heat emission over urban areas, dense buildings cause higher displacement heights and roughness lengths than flat surfaces; thus, aerodynamic resistances for heat are lower over built-up areas; this makes the sensible heat dissipation into atmosphere easier over built-up areas than over flat surfaces. {\copyright} 2004-2012 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Sloping terrain induces distortion of canopy reflectance (CR), and the retrieval of biophysical variables from remote sensing data needs to account for topographic effects. We developed a 1-D model (the path length correction (PLC)-based model) for simulating CR over sloping terrain. The effects of sloping terrain on single-order and diffuse scatterings are accounted for by PLC and modification of the fraction of incoming diffuse irradiance, respectively. The PLC model was validated via both Monte Carlo and remote sensing image simulations. The comparison with the Monte Carlo simulation revealed that the PLC model can capture the pattern of slope-induced reflectance distortion with high accuracy (red band: R2 = 0.88 ; root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.0045; relative RMSE (RRMSE) = 15{\%}; near infrared response (NIR) band: R2 = 0.79 ; RMSE = 0.041; RRMSE = 16{\%}). The comparison of the PLC-simulated results with remote sensing observations acquired by the Landsat8-OLI sensor revealed an accuracy similar to that with the Monte Carlo simulation (red band: R2 = 0.83 ; RMSE = 0.0053; RRMSE = 13{\%}; NIR band: R2 = 0.77 ; RMSE = 0.023; RRMSE = 8{\%}). To further validate the PLC model, we used it to implement topographic normalization; the results showed a large reduction in topographic effects after normalization, which implied that the PLC model captures reflectance variations caused by terrain. The PLC model provides a promising tool to improve the simulation of CR and the retrieval of biophysical variables over mountainous regions. {\copyright} 2017 IEEE.},

@article{Yin.2018,
 abstract = {Rugged terrain distorts optical remote sensing signals, and land-cover classification and biophysical parameter retrieval over mountainous regions must account for topographic effects. Therefore, topographic correction is a prerequisite for many remote sensing applications. In this study, we proposed a semi-physically based and simple topographic correction method for vegetation canopies based on path length correction (PLC). The PLC method was derived from the solution to the classic radiative transfer equation, and the influence of terrain on the radiative transfer process within the canopy is explicitly considered, making PLC physically sound. The radiative transfer equation was simplified to make PLC mathematically simple. Near-nadir observations derived from a Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image covering a mountainous region and wide field-of-view observations derived from simulation using a canopy reflectance model were combined to test the PLC correction method. Multi-criteria were used to provide objective evaluation results. The performances were compared to that of five other methods: CC, SCS + C, and SE, which are empirical parameter-based methods, and SCS and D-S, which are semi-physical methods without empirical parameter. All the six methods could significantly reduce the topographic effects. However, SCS showed obvious overcorrection for near-nadir observations. The correction results from D-S showed an obvious positive bias. For near-nadir observations, the performance of PLC was comparable to the well-validated parameter-based methods. For wide field-of-view observations, PLC obviously outperformed all other methods. Because of the physical soundness and mathematical simplicity, PLC provides an efficient approach to correct the terrain-induced canopy BRDF distortion and will facilitate the exploitation of multi-angular information for biophysical parameter retrieval over mountainous regions. {\copyright} 2018},

 abstract = {Urban heat island (UHI) is a phenomenon of high spatial and temporal variabilities. It can develop during night or daytime. UHI monitoring is possible through thermal satellite remote sensing of land surface temperature (LST). LST over large areas (size of a city) can be measured at high temporal resolution merely from instruments on-board geostationary satellites. These can cover the diurnal cycle as they provide data even every 5. min (SEVIRI rapid scanning). Sensors on-board the geostationary satellites have, however, poor spatial resolution. Using high spatial resolution is in many regions most important because LST is a spatially inhomogeneous parameter especially in urban areas. UHI characteristics are correlated with the land cover and micro-relief parameters. These are often available in a higher spatial resolution (e.g. NDVI and EVI). Thus, we employed them to enhance the spatial resolution of the SEVIRI LST over central Europe - using moving window analysis - to 1000. m spatial resolution and temporal resolution of 15. min. For each SEVIRI pixel a multiple regression was run on the low resolution data. Regression equation was then used on the high resolution data in order to estimate LST of high spatial and temporal resolutions. The validation over urban areas showed that the downscaled SEVIRI LST is comparable with the MODIS LST with an average root mean square error of 2.5. K. The obtained results make possible to analyse the diurnal cycle of UHI. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

 abstract = {In mountainous areas, topographic shading effects exert significant influence on the spatial distribution of solar irradiance on the land surface, which should be considered in estimating and modeling physical, biological, and hydrological processes. Various algorithms have been proposed for quantitative assessment of the impact of topography on the arriving solar radiation on slopes in mountainous area based on digital elevation model (DEM). However, different algorithms tend to produce different results even based on the same DEM. In this study, two algorithms for determining the maximum horizontal viewing angle of terrain obstruction were compared in a catchment in the Qilian Mountains, Northwest China, which were identical except for the way in interpreting DEM. Two algorithms for calculating sky view factor were also compared. Then, different algorithm combinations were compared and their sensitivities to the horizontal resolution of DEM were investigated. Results showed that the differences in outputs of different algorithms and combinations were significant and cannot be ignored in estimating the spatial distribution of solar irradiance in mountainous areas. A simple ground validation concluded that the algorithm assuming a linear variation in elevation was a little better than that assuming a stepped variation in elevation in and among neighboring DEM cells. For calculating diffuse solar radiation, the algorithm based on a sloped coordinate system was theoretically better than that based on a horizontal coordinate system. It is worth noting that even though the estimated annual mean of solar irradiance over the study area was almost the same among some algorithm combinations, the difference in spatial distribution was significant, which may lead to consequent difference in assessing or modeling some other environmental variables relevant to surface energy exchange, e.g., evaporation, snowmelt, and ground temperature. However, the analysis in this study was mainly theoretical, and further ground-based validations should be made in future. {\copyright} 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

 abstract = {The solar radiation incident in a mountainous area with a complex terrain has a strong spatial heterogeneity due to the variations in slope orientation (self-shading) and shadows cast by surrounding topography agents (topographic shading). Although slope self-shading has been well studied and considered in most land surface and hydrological models, topographic shading is usually ignored, and its influence on the thermal and hydrological processes in a cold mountainous area remains unclear. In this study, a topographic solar radiation algorithm with consideration for both slope self-shading and topographic shadows has been implemented and incorporated into a distributed hydrological model with physically based descriptions for the energy balance. A promising model performance was achieved according to a vigorous evaluation. In a control model without considering the topographic shadows, the simulated solar radiation incident in the study area was about 14.3~W/m2 higher on average, which in turn led to a higher simulated annual mean ground temperature at 4~m (by 0.41~°C) and evapotranspiration (by 16.1~mm/a), and a smaller permafrost extent (reduced by about 8{\%}), as well as smaller maximal snow depth and shorter snow duration. Although the simulation was not significantly improved for discharge hydrograph in the base model, higher river runoff peaks and an increased runoff depth were obtained. In areas with a rugged terrain and deep valleys, the influences of topographic shadows would even be stronger in reality than the presented results, which cannot be ignored in the simulation of the thermal and hydrological processes, especially in a refined model. {\copyright}2018.
