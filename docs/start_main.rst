Getting started
===============

The ``rvt`` Python package contains three modules:

* **vis** (:ref:`rvt.vis`) for computing visualizations

* **blend** (:ref:`rvt.blend`) for blending visualizations together
  
* **default** (:ref:`rvt.default`) for defining default parameters with methods to compute and save visualization functions using set parameters

This section explains how to complete some basic visualisation tasks using these modules, as well as some information on how to choose which visualizations to use.

If you need some data to get started, a `small sample dataset <https://github.com/EarthObservation/RVT_py/blob/master/test_data/TM1_564_146.tif>`_ (2.43 MB) and a `larger sample dataset <https://rebrand.ly/rvt_demo>`_ (152 MB) are available for download.

.. tip:: Carlos Carbajal has written an excellent two-part blog post on the use of RVT in Python and QGIS (in Spanish). You can check it out here: `Part 1 <https://carbajallosa.blogspot.com/2021/03/uso-del-relief-visualization-toolbox.html>`_ & `Part 2 <https://carbajallosa.blogspot.com/2021/03/uso-del-relief-visualization-toolbox_16.html>`_.
