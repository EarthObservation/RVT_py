Which visualizations should I use?
==================================

This section contains a list of the visualizations that RVT can produce with introductory descriptions.

Unless otherwise referenced, the descriptions are simplified versions of the information available in Kokalj, Žiga, Ralf Hesse. 2017. `Airborne laser scanning raster data visualization: A Guide to Good Practice <https://omp.zrc-sazu.si/zalozba/catalog/book/824>`_. Ljubljana: Založba ZRC. The tables in this section can also be found in this publication (pages 34–35).

Getting started
---------------

When choosing a visualization, it is recommended to always begin by looking at a hillshade of the area under investigation, as the provide the most ‘natural’ visual appearance of the topography and can help you decide which other techniques could work well.

If you need some help to get started after trying a hillshade, consider the type of archaeological feature you're working with:

**Table 1: Suitability of visualisation techniques for representing selected archaeological topographical features.**

You can also try adding techniques from Table 2, in order from left to right, based on the topography of the area under investigation.

Below is a visual version of the information provided in Table 2.
