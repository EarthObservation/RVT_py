The plugin uses RVT python (core) library. You can find more about it at `Relief Visualization Toolbox in Python <https://rvt-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and `Github Relief Visualization Toolbox in Python <https://github.com/EarthObservation/RVT_py>`_.

To install the plugin open QGIS, select ``Plugins → Manage and Install Plugins → All``. Search for: ``RVT`` or ``Relief Visualization Toolbox`` and click install.

Once the plugin is installed, it can be accessed from the ``Raster menu`` or just click the icon that should appear on the toolbar. All the visualization functions are also available as processing functions in the ``Processing toolbox``.
