Slope

Slope (gradient) is the first derivative of a DEM and is aspect independent. It represents the maximum rate of change between each cell and its neighbours and can be calculated either as percentage of slope or degree of slope.

Additional information is needed to distinguish between positive/convex (e.g. banks) and negative/concave (e.g. ditches) features since slopes of the same gradient (regardless of rising or falling) are presented with the same colour.
