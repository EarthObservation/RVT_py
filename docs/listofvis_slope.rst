Slope
=====

.. image:: ./figures/rvtvis_slope.png

Slope (gradient) represents the maximum rate of change between each cell and its neighbours. It can be calculated either as percentage of slope or degree of slope. It is the first derivative of a DEM and is aspect independent.

Additional information is needed to distinguish between positive/convex (e.g. banks) and negative/concave (e.g. ditches) features, since slopes of the same gradient, regardless of rising or falling, are presented with the same colour.
