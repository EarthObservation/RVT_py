=================

To use RVT in QGIS, first open QGIS and select ``Plugins → Manage and Install Plugins → All``.

Search for ``RVT`` or ``Relief Visualization Toolbox`` and select ``Install Plugin``.

Once the plugin is installed, it can be accessed from the ``Raster menu`` or by selecting the icon that will appear on the toolbar. All the visualization functions are also available as processing functions in the ``Processing toolbox``.

The RVT QGIS plugin can also be downloaded from the `QGIS Python Plugins Repository <https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/rvt-qgis/>`_.
